essentials; REMEMBER EACH DESCRIPTION
# Next.js App Router Development Patterns

## Directory Structure (app/)

- *Routing:* Use folder-based routing. page.tsx defines UI, layout.tsx defines shared UI, loading.tsx for loading states, error.tsx for error boundaries.
- *Route Groups:* Use (groupName) folders to organize routes without affecting the URL path (e.g., (marketing)/about/page.tsx).
- *Private Folders:* Prefix folder names with _ (e.g., _components) to prevent them from being included in routing.

## Component Types

- *Server Components (Default):* Use for components that fetch data server-side, access backend resources directly, or don't require interactivity/state. Keep sensitive logic here.
- *Client Components:* Use 'use client'; directive at the top for components requiring state (useState, useReducer), lifecycle effects (useEffect), browser APIs, or event listeners. Keep client bundles small. Interleave Client Components within Server Components where needed.

## Data Fetching

- *Server Components:* Use async/await directly within Server Components. Leverage React Server Components caching. Fetch data in layout.tsx, page.tsx, or dedicated Server Components. Use fetch with Next.js extended options for caching/revalidation.
- *Client Components:* Fetch data client-side using libraries like SWR or React Query, or within useEffect. Alternatively, pass data fetched in Server Components down as props.
- *Server Actions:* Use for form submissions and data mutations. Define actions within Server Components or in separate files ('use server';). Bind actions to forms or call them from Client Components.

## Caching & Revalidation

- Utilize Next.js fetch caching (cache: 'force-cache', cache: 'no-store') and revalidation options (next: { revalidate: seconds }).
- Use revalidatePath and revalidateTag within Server Actions or API routes to invalidate cached data on demand.

## Examples

typescript
// app/users/[id]/page.tsx (Server Component)
async function getUserData(id: string) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/users/${id}`, { next: { revalidate: 3600 } });
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch user');
  return res.json();
}

export default async function UserProfilePage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const userData = await getUserData(params.id);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{userData.name}</h1>
      {/* Pass data to Client Components if needed */}
      {/* <InteractiveUserActions user={userData} /> */}
    </div>
  );
}

# React Component Development Standards

## Component Structure

- *File Naming:* Use PascalCase (e.g., UserProfile.tsx). Colocate styles/tests if applicable.
- *Exports:* Use named exports primarily. Default exports for page components if necessary.
- *Props:* Define props using TypeScript interfaces (e.g., interface UserProfileProps { ... }). Place interface definition directly above the component.
- *Hooks:* Call hooks at the top level of the component, before any conditional logic or return statements.
- *Imports:* Order imports: React -> external libraries -> internal modules/components -> assets/styles.

## State Management

- *Simple State:* Use useState for simple, local component state.
- *Complex State/Logic:* Consider useReducer for state transitions involving multiple sub-values or complex logic.
- *Shared State:* For state shared across multiple components, use Context API for simple cases or a dedicated state management library (e.g., Zustand, Redux Toolkit) for more complex applications. Avoid prop drilling excessively.

## Styling

- Primarily use Tailwind CSS utility classes via the className prop.
- For dynamic styles based on props or state, use libraries like clsx or cva.
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary for dynamic values that cannot be represented by utilities.

## Examples

typescript
// Example Structure
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { fetchUserData } from '../utils/api'; // Internal module
import styles from './UserProfile.module.css'; // CSS Module (if not using Tailwind exclusively)

interface UserProfileProps {
  userId: string;
}

export const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ userId }) => {
  const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);
  // ... other hooks

  // Effects and handlers...

  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded"> {/* Tailwind example */}
      {/* ... component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
};

# Tailwind CSS Usage Guidelines

## Configuration (tailwind.config.js)

- *Theme Customization:* Define project-specific colors, fonts, spacing, breakpoints, etc., within theme.extend. Avoid modifying the base theme directly unless necessary. Reference design tokens if applicable.
- *Plugins:* List all required official and third-party plugins (e.g., @tailwindcss/forms, @tailwindcss/typography).
- *Content:* Ensure the content array accurately reflects all file paths where Tailwind classes are used (e.g., ./app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}, ./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}).

## Utility Class Usage

- *Prefer Utilities:* Use utility classes directly in HTML/JSX whenever possible.
- *Readability:* For long lists of utilities, consider formatting them across multiple lines or using tools/plugins that help manage class strings (e.g., prettier-plugin-tailwindcss).
- **Avoid @apply:** Use @apply sparingly in global CSS files for base styles or very complex, reusable component patterns only if necessary. Overuse can negate Tailwind's benefits. Prefer component abstractions in React/Vue/etc.
- *No Arbitrary Values (Generally):* Stick to the defined theme values. Use arbitrary values ([color: #123456], [margin: 13px]) only as a last resort for unique exceptions that don't warrant a theme addition. Document reasons for their use.

## Component Styling Patterns

- *Buttons:* Define standard button styles using utility combinations. Consider using cva (Class Variance Authority) for variants (primary, secondary, sizes).
- *Cards:* Establish consistent padding, background, border, and shadow utilities for card elements.
- *Forms:* Utilize the @tailwindcss/forms plugin for sensible default form styling and customize as needed.

## Example (cva pattern for Buttons)

typescript
// components/Button.tsx
import { cva, type VariantProps } from 'class-variance-authority';
import React from 'react';

const buttonVariants = cva(
  'inline-flex items-center justify-center rounded-md font-medium transition-colors focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2',
  {
    variants: {
      variant: {
        default: 'bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 focus:ring-blue-500',
        secondary: 'bg-gray-200 text-gray-800 hover:bg-gray-300 focus:ring-gray-400',
        destructive: 'bg-red-600 text-white hover:bg-red-700 focus:ring-red-500',
      },
      size: {
        default: 'h-10 px-4 py-2',
        sm: 'h-9 rounded-md px-3',
        lg: 'h-11 rounded-md px-8',
      },
    },
    defaultVariants: {
      variant: 'default',
      size: 'default',
    },
  }
);

interface ButtonProps extends React.ButtonHTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement>, VariantProps<typeof buttonVariants> {}

export const Button = React.forwardRef<HTMLButtonElement, ButtonProps>(
  ({ className, variant, size, ...props }, ref) => {
    return <button className={buttonVariants({ variant, size, className })} ref={ref} {...props} />;
  }
);
Button.displayName = 'Button';

⏱ Tempo System Standards

(General-Purpose Framework for Productivity, Rhythm, and Sustainable Creative Flow)

⸻

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	Tempo = Balance × Momentum.
It’s not about moving fast; it’s about moving consistently, in rhythm.
	•	Work with rhythm, not rush.
The best results come from structured, iterative cycles — sprints, reflections, and resets.
	•	Predictability builds freedom.
When your workflow is consistent, you have more room for creativity.
	•	Measure → Adjust → Sustain.
Tempo emphasizes continuous optimization — not perfectionism.

⸻

2️⃣ The Four Dimensions of Tempo

Dimension	Focus	Description
1. Focus	Cognitive rhythm	Managing attention, deep work, and context switching
2. Flow	Work rhythm	Task progression, sprint pacing, and productive energy
3. Feedback	Reflection rhythm	Review cycles, retrospectives, and performance tracking
4. Freedom	Rest rhythm	Recharge, downtime, and creative resets

Each dimension feeds the others — you can’t maintain speed without recovery, or structure without reflection.

⸻

3️⃣ Tempo Framework Overview

🧭 Daily Cycle
	•	Plan (AM) → Review tasks, priorities, and blockers.
	•	Produce (Midday) → Deep work in uninterrupted blocks.
	•	Polish (PM) → Wrap up, review outcomes, log reflections.
	•	Pause (Evening) → Step away intentionally.

📆 Weekly Cycle

Day	Focus	Description
Monday	Setup	Planning, sprint goal alignment
Tuesday–Thursday	Execution	Deep work, creative output
Friday	Reflection	Review, documentation, learning
Weekend	Recharge	Disconnect, creativity, hobbies

🌀 Monthly Cycle
	1.	Review completed projects
	2.	Analyze energy trends (time spent vs. value delivered)
	3.	Set next-month learning or performance goals
	4.	Archive and clean workspace

⸻

4️⃣ Tools & Integrations

Tempo doesn’t require specific apps — it adapts to your stack.
But it thrives when connected across systems:

Layer	Tool Examples	Purpose
Planning	Notion, ClickUp, Linear	Task and sprint tracking
Focus	Replit, VS Code, Cursor	Deep work coding environments
Reflection	Obsidian, Aurelius, Logseq	Journaling and notes
Automation	Zapier, GitHub Actions, Supabase Scripts	Reduce repetitive tasks
Wellness	Apple Health, Google Fit, Calm	Balance and recovery tracking


⸻

5️⃣ Rhythm Settings

Think of Tempo like a metronome for your workflow:

Mode	Description	Ideal Use Case
Slow (60-80 BPM)	Deep focus, writing, or design work	Code review, copywriting
Medium (90-110 BPM)	Balanced pace, moderate complexity	UI building, data modeling
Fast (120-140 BPM)	High-energy creative sprints	Brainstorms, hackathons
Silent Mode	No notifications or interruptions	Strategic planning, study sessions


⸻

6️⃣ Task & Sprint Management

🎯 Task Design
	•	Start every task with a verb (“Design layout”, “Implement chat RLS”).
	•	Define a clear deliverable and time box (e.g., “90 min deep work”).
	•	Break large goals into mini-milestones (45–90 min chunks).

⏳ Pomodoro + Deep Work Hybrid
	•	Use 45 min focus blocks → 10 min breaks → 3–4 cycles per session.
	•	After every 3 hours, take a longer 30–45 min break.

🔁 Sprint Flow
	1.	Plan sprint objectives (Monday)
	2.	Break into atomic tasks
	3.	Execute daily deep work blocks
	4.	End week with a reflection log

⸻

7️⃣ Environment Setup

🧩 Digital
	•	Keep all projects in clearly labeled folders (Base44, Designs, Experiments).
	•	Sync notes automatically (Notion/Obsidian).
	•	Automate file versioning via GitHub or Replit autosave.

🌿 Physical
	•	Declutter desk: keep one notebook, one drink, one device.
	•	Use lighting cues: bright for morning, warm for night.
	•	Create a visual “start/stop” ritual (e.g., open laptop, start timer, headphones on).

⸻

8️⃣ Time-Blocking Blueprint

Block	Duration	Purpose
Block 1	8:00 – 10:00 AM	Deep focus coding or design
Block 2	10:30 – 12:00 PM	Secondary project or writing
Block 3	1:30 – 3:00 PM	Meetings / collaborative work
Block 4	3:30 – 5:00 PM	Learning, QA, or cleanup
Evening	6:00 PM →	Rest, reflection, physical activity

Keep each block single-purpose — no multitasking.

⸻

9️⃣ Tempo Metrics

📈 Quantitative
	•	Focus Time Logged (hrs/day)
	•	Tasks Completed vs. Planned (%)
	•	Context Switches (per day)
	•	Interruptions (tracked manually)

📊 Qualitative
	•	Energy Level (1–10 scale)
	•	Mood Check-in (before/after work)
	•	Learning Notes (one insight per session)

Combine these data points to refine your weekly rhythm.

⸻

🔟 Reflection & Journaling

🧠 Daily Reflection Prompts
	•	What one thing moved your project forward today?
	•	What interrupted your flow — and how can you prevent it?
	•	What did you learn today?

🪞 Weekly Reflection
	•	What was your most productive day and why?
	•	Which tasks drained energy?
	•	Which habits helped sustain focus?

🧭 Monthly Reflection
	•	Review project velocity.
	•	Audit goals versus effort.
	•	Adjust tools or rituals.

⸻

11️⃣ Collaboration & Team Tempo

👥 Team Cadence

Rhythm	Duration	Focus
Daily Standup	10 min	Sync progress & blockers
Weekly Sync	30 min	Review sprint & feedback
Monthly Review	60 min	Strategic planning & reflection

💬 Communication Norms
	•	Default to asynchronous updates unless urgent.
	•	Respect “focus hours” — minimize pings during deep work.
	•	Summarize every meeting in 3 bullet “Next Actions.”

🔄 Alignment
	•	Use shared Tempo dashboards (Notion or Linear).
	•	Tag deliverables by phase: plan, build, review, done.
	•	Encourage self-reported “energy levels” for realistic scheduling.

⸻

12️⃣ Tempo Stack (Recommended Integrations)

Category	Tool	Function
Timer	FlowTime, Pomofocus, Toggl	Measure focus sessions
Planner	Notion, Sunsama, Akiflow	Manage daily and weekly tasks
Code	Cursor, Replit, VS Code	Primary work environments
Writing	Obsidian, Logseq	Reflection and notes
AI	GPT-5, Opus 4.1, Sonnet 4.5	Generate summaries, track patterns
Health	Apple Health, Forest, Calm	Maintain focus and rest balance


⸻

13️⃣ Energy Management
	•	Respect ultradian rhythms: focus peaks every 90–120 min.
	•	Hydrate & move every hour.
	•	Use music to match cognitive demand:
	•	Ambient for coding
	•	Instrumental for writing
	•	Silence for problem solving
	•	Track energy dips and plan light tasks there (emails, reviews).

⸻

14️⃣ Productivity Anti-Patterns

🚫 Overplanning → Wastes creative energy
🚫 Multitasking → Fragmented focus
🚫 Working late repeatedly → Destroys rhythm
🚫 Skipping reflection → No course correction
🚫 Ignoring health → Leads to burnout

⸻

15️⃣ Automation & AI Alignment

Tempo integrates with your AI ecosystem to maintain consistency:

AI Tool	Role in Tempo
Cursor	Code faster without context-switching
GPT-5 / Sonnet / Opus	Generate summaries, reviews, or insights
Supabase Functions	Automate task and metrics logging
Base44 CLI	Trigger reflections and report generation
Zapier / Make	Sync tasks and reflections across systems

AI supports rhythm — it shouldn’t replace intention.

⸻

16️⃣ Tempo Health Framework

🧘 Mental
	•	10-minute reflection after deep work.
	•	Journal frustrations before closing the day.

🏃 Physical
	•	Micro-break stretches between sprints.
	•	Walks or breathing exercises between blocks.

❤ Emotional
	•	Acknowledge progress weekly.
	•	Celebrate “small wins” to maintain motivation.

⸻

17️⃣ Versioning Tempo

Keep Tempo Logs in your repo or Notion:

/tempo/
 ┣ daily-logs/
 ┣ weekly-summaries/
 ┣ monthly-review.md
 ┗ energy-trends.csv

Each log includes:
	•	Focus time
	•	Wins and blockers
	•	Energy notes
	•	AI or teammate feedback

⸻

18️⃣ Integration with Base44

Tempo is the heartbeat of your Base44 ecosystem:

Base44 Layer	How Tempo Fits
Design	Defines review rhythm and inspiration time

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	Java = Stability + Structure + Scalability.
Designed to be write once, run anywhere — Java powers enterprise systems, APIs, and large-scale web applications.
	•	Goal: Build clean, modular, and maintainable software that is type-safe, secure, and performs consistently across environments.
	•	Principle: “Code for clarity first, performance second.”

“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.” — Abelson & Sussman

⸻

2️⃣ Key Features of Java

Feature	Description
Object-Oriented	Everything is modeled as classes and objects.
Platform Independent	Compiles to bytecode that runs on any JVM.
Statically Typed	Type checking occurs at compile time.
Garbage Collection	Automatic memory management.
Multithreading	Native support for concurrency.
Rich Standard Library	Includes utilities for I/O, networking, data structures, and more.
Strong Ecosystem	Frameworks like Spring, Hibernate, Jakarta EE, and Android SDK.


⸻

3️⃣ Project Structure

Typical Maven or Gradle project:

project-root/
 ├── src/
 │   ├── main/
 │   │   ├── java/com/base44/app/
 │   │   │   ├── controllers/
 │   │   │   ├── models/
 │   │   │   ├── services/
 │   │   │   └── utils/
 │   │   └── resources/
 │   │       ├── application.properties
 │   │       └── templates/
 │   └── test/java/com/base44/app/
 ├── pom.xml (Maven) or build.gradle (Gradle)
 └── README.md

Layered Convention:
	•	Controller layer: Handles API requests.
	•	Service layer: Contains business logic.
	•	Repository (DAO): Manages database persistence.
	•	Model layer: Defines data structures/entities.

⸻

4️⃣ Java Syntax Overview

Basic Example:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Base44!");
    }
}

Variables & Types:

int age = 25;
String name = "Ahnaf";
boolean active = true;
double salary = 50000.75;

Control Structures:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}

if (age >= 18) {
    System.out.println("Adult");
} else {
    System.out.println("Minor");
}


⸻

5️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Principle	Description	Example
Encapsulation	Keep data private, expose through methods.	Private fields + getters/setters.
Abstraction	Hide complexity via interfaces or abstract classes.	abstract class Vehicle {}
Inheritance	Reuse fields and methods from parent classes.	class Car extends Vehicle {}
Polymorphism	Use shared interfaces with multiple implementations.	Animal a = new Dog(); a.speak();

Example:

abstract class Animal {
    abstract void speak();
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Woof"); }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Meow"); }
}


⸻

6️⃣ Collections Framework

Type	Interface	Example Implementation
List	Ordered, allows duplicates	ArrayList, LinkedList
Set	Unique elements	HashSet, TreeSet
Map	Key-value pairs	HashMap, TreeMap
Queue/Deque	FIFO / double-ended	LinkedList, ArrayDeque

Example:

List<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
names.add("Ahnaf");
names.add("Ishmam");
for (String n : names) {
    System.out.println(n);
}


⸻

7️⃣ Exception Handling

Use try-catch blocks for predictable errors and throw custom exceptions when appropriate.

try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero!");
} finally {
    System.out.println("Cleanup complete.");
}

Custom exception:

public class InvalidInputException extends Exception {
    public InvalidInputException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}


⸻

8️⃣ File I/O and Streams

Reading a File

try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("data.txt"))) {
    String line;
    while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
}

Writing a File

try (BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("output.txt"))) {
    bw.write("Hello World!");
}


⸻

9️⃣ Multithreading

Threads allow concurrent task execution.

class Task extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task running on " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Task t1 = new Task();
        t1.start();
    }
}

Or with Runnable:

Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Running in " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
new Thread(task).start();


⸻

🔟 Modern Java Features (Java 8 → 21)

Feature	Description	Example
Lambdas	Anonymous functions	(a, b) -> a + b

    public List<User> getUsers() {
        return userService.getAllUsers();
    }
}

Hibernate / JPA

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) for databases.

@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {

	•	One class per file.
	•	Max 120 characters per line.
	•	Add Javadoc for all public methods.
	•	Organize imports automatically (Ctrl + Alt + O in IntelliJ).
	•	Use final for constants and immutable variables.

Example:

/**
 * Calculates compound interest.
 * @param principal - initial amount
 * @param rate - annual interest rate
 * @param time - years
 * @return total amount after interest
 */
public double calculateInterest(double principal, double rate, int time) {
    return principal * Math.pow(1 + rate / 100, time);
}

✅ Secure your APIs
✅ Tune JVM performance
✅ Automate builds and deployment
✅ Follow consistent naming and formatting
✅ Keep business logic separate from data access
✅ Leverage modern Java features responsibly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
⚡ JavaScript Standards

(General-Purpose Development Guide for Modern Web Applications)

⸻

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	JavaScript = Logic + Interactivity + Accessibility.
It bridges human actions (clicks, input, events) with machine responses (rendering, state updates, data calls).
	•	Goal: Write clear, predictable, and maintainable code that works across environments — browsers, Node.js, and serverless platforms.
	•	Principle: Optimize for clarity first, performance second, and brevity last.

“Readable code scales better than clever code.”

⸻

2️⃣ Core Concepts

Concept	Description	Example
Dynamic Typing	Variables can change type during runtime.	let value = 5; value = 'five';
Prototypal Inheritance	Objects inherit directly from other objects.	Object.create(proto)
Event Loop	Manages async operations in a single-threaded runtime.	setTimeout, Promises, async/await
Closures	Functions remember variables from their lexical scope.	function counter() { let n=0; return ()=>++n }
Hoisting	Declarations move to the top of their scope.	var hoisted; let/const not initialized early
Context (this)	Depends on how a function is called.	obj.method() vs method()
Modules	Organized code into import/export boundaries.	export function sum(a,b){} / import { sum } from './math'


⸻

3️⃣ Modern JavaScript Versions

ES6+ Features to Always Use

✅ Block Scoping: let, const
✅ Arrow Functions: const greet = name => \Hi, ${name};  ✅ **Template Literals:** Dynamic strings   ✅ **Destructuring:**const { id, name } = user;  ✅ **Default Params:**function say(msg = ‘Hello’)  ✅ **Spread/Rest:**const arr = […oldArr, newItem]  ✅ **Modules:**import/exportsyntax   ✅ **Promises + async/await:** Handle asynchronous code   ✅ **Classes:** Object-oriented syntax sugar   ✅ **Optional Chaining:**user?.address?.street  ✅ **Nullish Coalescing:**const val = input ?? ‘default’

⸻

4️⃣ File Structure & Naming

Convention	Example
Use camelCase for variables/functions	getUserData, handleSubmit
Use PascalCase for classes/components	UserCard, ChatMessage
Use kebab-case for file names	user-service.js, form-handler.js
One file = one responsibility	auth.js for auth logic only
Keep directories organized	utils/, services/, components/, api/


⸻

5️⃣ Code Style

Follow consistent, readable style — ideally enforced via Prettier + ESLint.

✅ Preferred

const users = await fetchUsers();
for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user.name);
}

❌ Avoid

var u=fetchUsers().then(a=>a.forEach(b=>console.log(b.name)));

Style Rules
	•	Use const by default; use let only if value changes.
	•	Avoid var.
	•	Indent with 2 spaces.
	•	Use trailing commas in arrays/objects.
	•	Prefer single quotes for strings 'Hello'.
	•	Use semicolon-less style only if your team standardizes it.

⸻

6️⃣ Functions

Type	Use Case	Example
Named Function	Reusable, self-documenting	function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
Arrow Function	Inline, lexical this	const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;
Immediately Invoked Function (IIFE)	Scope isolation	(function(){ ... })()
Async Function	Asynchronous logic	async function fetchData() { ... }

Guidelines
	•	Keep functions pure where possible (no side effects).
	•	Use default parameters.
	•	Limit to ~20 lines — extract logic if longer.
	•	Document complex functions using JSDoc.

⸻

7️⃣ Asynchronous Patterns

1. Promises

fetch('/api/data')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);

2. Async/Await

try {
  const res = await fetch('/api/data');
  const data = await res.json();
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Fetch failed:', err);
}

Rules:
	•	Always handle .catch or try/catch.
	•	Avoid mixing callbacks and async/await.
	•	Use Promise.all or Promise.allSettled for parallel async tasks.

⸻

8️⃣ Objects & Arrays

Object Shorthand

const name = 'Ahnaf';
const user = { name }; // instead of { name: name }

Destructuring

const { email, age } = user;

Array Methods

Method	Purpose
map()	Transform items
filter()	Keep subset
reduce()	Aggregate
forEach()	Iterate
find()	Find first match
some() / every()	Logical checks

Prefer functional methods over for loops for clarity.

⸻

9️⃣ Error Handling

Use try/catch for async logic

try {
  const user = await getUser(id);
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Failed to load user:', err.message);
}

Validate Input Early

if (!email.includes('@')) throw new Error('Invalid email');

Graceful Degradation
	•	Show fallback UIs for errors.
	•	Log errors meaningfully (include file/module names).

⸻

🔟 Modular Design

Example:

// utils/math.js
export function add(a, b) { return a + b; }

// app.js
import { add } from './utils/math.js';
console.log(add(5, 7));

	•	Avoid large “god files”.
	•	Keep imports organized (external → internal).
	•	Use index.js in folders for exports aggregation.

⸻

11️⃣ DOM & Event Handling

Technique	Description	Example
Querying Elements	Use modern selectors	document.querySelector('.btn')
Events	Always clean up listeners	el.addEventListener('click', handler)
Delegation	Attach events to parent	parent.addEventListener('click', e => {...})
Avoid Inline JS	Never use onclick="" in HTML	use addEventListener instead
Accessibility	Support keyboard input (keydown, focus)	


⸻

12️⃣ Best Practices

✅ Keep functions small and modular
✅ Avoid global variables
✅ Always declare strict mode ('use strict';)
✅ Avoid mutating shared state
✅ Use ES Modules instead of script tags
✅ Use async/await instead of callbacks
✅ Always handle Promise rejections
✅ Sanitize user input before using in DOM or DB
✅ Write comments for logic, not obvious syntax

⸻

13️⃣ Performance Tips

Optimization	Description
Debounce/Throttle Events	Limit rapid triggers
Memoize Results	Cache expensive calls
Lazy Load Assets	Defer heavy scripts
Use Web Workers	Offload CPU-heavy tasks
Minimize DOM Manipulation	Batch updates
Avoid Memory Leaks	Remove listeners, clear timers
Bundle Wisely	Tree-shake and minify for production


⸻

14️⃣ Testing & Debugging
	•	Use console.log() for quick checks, but remove in production.
	•	Use Chrome DevTools / VS Code Debugger for breakpoints.
	•	Use Jest, Vitest, or Mocha for automated testing.
	•	Write unit tests for pure functions.
	•	Write integration tests for API logic.

Example:

test('adds numbers', () => {
  expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
});


⸻

15️⃣ Documentation & Comments

Use JSDoc for functions, especially public APIs.

/**
 * Calculates area of a rectangle
 * @param {number} w - Width
 * @param {number} h - Height
 * @returns {number}
 */
function area(w, h) {
  return w * h;
}

Rules:
	•	Explain why, not what.
	•	Keep comments updated.
	•	Use consistent formatting.

⸻

16️⃣ Security Practices
	•	Escape user input to prevent XSS.
	•	Use textContent instead of innerHTML for inserts.
	•	Avoid eval-like functions (eval, new Function).
	•	Store secrets on the server, never in frontend JS.
	•	Sanitize API inputs and outputs.

⸻

17️⃣ Tooling & Linting

Install:

npm install eslint prettier --save-dev

Sample .eslintrc:

{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:prettier/recommended"],
  "env": { "browser": true, "node": true, "es2023": true }
}

Benefits:
	•	Prevents syntax errors.
	•	Enforces team consistency.
	•	Works seamlessly with VS Code + Cursor.

⸻

18️⃣ Integration with Base44 Ecosystem

Layer	JS Role
React / Next.js	Component logic, effects, events
Supabase / APIs	Async data handling
Tailwind	Dynamic class toggles
TypeScript	Type-safe expansion of JS
Roo Code / Cursor	Smart refactoring and inline completion
Ellipsis	Inline doc clarity
Tempo	Logs and reflection cycles


⸻

19️⃣ Common Anti-Patterns

❌ Callback hell
❌ Deeply nested loops
❌ Global variables
❌ Mutating objects directly
❌ Missing await in async calls
❌ Ignoring errors silently
❌ Inline HTML event handlers
❌ Mixing logic and presentation

⸻

20️⃣ Summary Principles

✅ Keep JS modular and human-readable
✅ Prefer ES6+ patterns
✅ Document intent, not syntax
✅ Embrace async safely
✅ Prioritize clarity and testability
✅ Follow consistent linting & formatting
✅ Integrate JS cleanly with React, Tailwind, Supabase
✅ Use AI tools (Copilot, Roo Code, Cursor) for productivity, not dependency

🍃 MongoDB Query Language (MQL) Standards

(General-Purpose Development & Querying Guide for MongoDB / NoSQL Systems)

⸻

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	MongoDB = Flexibility + Scalability + Speed.
It’s a document-oriented NoSQL database optimized for semi-structured, JSON-like data.
	•	Goal: Write structured, predictable, and efficient MongoDB queries that scale across large datasets without sacrificing clarity.
	•	Principle: Structure documents as if they were small, self-contained APIs — logical, minimal, and query-friendly.

“Design your documents for how you query them, not just how you store them.”

⸻

2️⃣ Key Characteristics

Feature	Description
Document-Oriented	Stores data as BSON (Binary JSON) documents ({ key: value }).
Schema-Less (Flexible)	Each document can have different fields.
Collections, not Tables	Similar to SQL tables but unstructured.
Documents, not Rows	Each document is a JSON-like object.
Indexes	Accelerate query performance.
Aggregation Framework	Used for analytics, grouping, and transformations.
Replica Sets & Sharding	High availability and horizontal scaling.


⸻

3️⃣ Core Terminology Comparison

SQL Term	MongoDB Equivalent
Database	Database
Table	Collection
Row	Document
Column	Field
Primary Key	_id (auto-generated ObjectId)
Index	Index
JOIN	$lookup
GROUP BY	$group
WHERE	{ <field>: <condition> }
INSERT	insertOne(), insertMany()
UPDATE	updateOne(), updateMany()
DELETE	deleteOne(), deleteMany()


⸻

4️⃣ Basic CRUD Operations

📥 Insert Documents

db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Ahnaf Ishmam",
  email: "ahnaf@example.com",
  active: true,
  createdAt: new Date()
});

db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "John Doe", role: "teacher" },
  { name: "Jane Doe", role: "student" }
]);


⸻

📤 Read Documents

db.users.find(); // All documents
db.users.find({ active: true }); // Filter
db.users.find({ role: "teacher" }).limit(5).sort({ createdAt: -1 });

Use projection to select specific fields:

db.users.find({}, { name: 1, email: 1, _id: 0 });


⸻

🔁 Update Documents

db.users.updateOne(
  { email: "ahnaf@example.com" },
  { $set: { active: false } }
);

db.users.updateMany(
  { role: "student" },
  { $set: { verified: true } }
);

Common Operators:
$set, $inc, $push, $pull, $unset, $rename

Example:

db.users.updateOne({ _id: 123 }, { $inc: { loginCount: 1 } });


⸻

❌ Delete Documents

db.users.deleteOne({ email: "inactive@example.com" });
db.users.deleteMany({ active: false });

Always test filters before deleting. Use find() with the same condition first.

⸻

5️⃣ Query Operators

Type	Operators	Example
Comparison	$eq, $ne, $gt, $gte, $lt, $lte, $in, $nin	{ age: { $gt: 18 } }
Logical	$and, $or, $not, $nor	{ $or: [{ role: 'admin' }, { verified: true }] }
Element	$exists, $type	{ email: { $exists: true } }
Evaluation	$regex, $expr, $text	{ name: { $regex: /^A/, $options: 'i' } }
Array	$all, $elemMatch, $size	{ tags: { $all: ['mongodb', 'database'] } }
Update	$set, $push, $inc, $addToSet, $pull	{ $push: { roles: 'teacher' } }


⸻

6️⃣ Aggregation Framework

Aggregation replaces SQL’s GROUP BY, JOIN, and complex reports.
It’s built around a pipeline of stages that transform data step-by-step.

Example:

db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", totalSpent: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } },
  { $limit: 5 }
]);

Common Stages:

Stage	Purpose
$match	Filter documents
$group	Group by field(s)
$sort	Sort results
$project	Select or reshape fields
$limit	Restrict count
$skip	Skip documents
$lookup	Join other collection
$unwind	Flatten arrays
$addFields	Add computed fields
$set	Alias for $addFields
$merge	Write results into another collection


⸻

Example $lookup (Join)

db.orders.aggregate([
  {
    $lookup: {
      from: "users",
      localField: "userId",
      foreignField: "_id",
      as: "user_info"
    }
  },
  { $unwind: "$user_info" },
  { $project: { "user_info.password": 0 } }
]);


⸻

7️⃣ Indexing & Performance

Create Index

db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 });
db.orders.createIndex({ userId: 1, createdAt: -1 });

List & Drop Indexes

db.users.getIndexes();
db.users.dropIndex("email_1");

Best Practices:
✅ Index query filters and sort keys
✅ Avoid too many indexes (hurts write performance)
✅ Use explain() to analyze query plans
✅ Use compound indexes for multi-field queries

⸻

8️⃣ Data Modeling Best Practices

Principle	Description
Embed vs Reference	Embed small related data; reference large or shared entities.
Pre-Aggregate	Store totals or summaries to avoid repetitive computation.
Avoid Deep Nesting	Limit to 2–3 levels for readability and performance.
Use Consistent Field Names	Maintain schema consistency across documents.
Use ObjectId	Let MongoDB handle unique IDs.
Document Size	Keep under 16MB limit (MongoDB’s max document size).
Avoid Arrays of Huge Length	Instead, store in related collections.

Example Schema (Hybrid)

{
  _id: ObjectId(),
  userId: ObjectId("..."),
  items: [
    { productId: ObjectId("..."), quantity: 2, price: 19.99 }
  ],
  status: "pending",
  totalAmount: 39.98,
  createdAt: ISODate(),
  updatedAt: ISODate()
}


⸻

9️⃣ Transactions (Multi-Document Writes)

MongoDB supports ACID transactions for multiple collections.

const session = db.getMongo().startSession();
session.startTransaction();

try {
  const users = session.getDatabase("shop").users;
  const orders = session.getDatabase("shop").orders;

  users.updateOne({ _id: 1 }, { $inc: { balance: -50 } });
  orders.insertOne({ userId: 1, total: 50 });

  session.commitTransaction();
} catch (e) {
  session.abortTransaction();
}


⸻

🔟 Security & Validation

Practice	Description
Schema Validation	Use JSON Schema validation in collections
Role-Based Access	Create DB users with limited roles
Avoid $where	Don’t use JavaScript-based queries (can execute arbitrary code)
Sanitize Inputs	Prevent NoSQL injection
TLS/SSL	Encrypt connections
Authentication	Always require user login (SCRAM, x.509, etc.)

Example:

db.createCollection("users", {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      bsonType: "object",
      required: ["email", "password"],
      properties: {
        email: { bsonType: "string", pattern: "^.+@.+\\..+$" },
        password: { bsonType: "string", minLength: 8 }
      }
    }
  }
});


⸻

11️⃣ Backup & Monitoring

Tool	Purpose
mongodump / mongorestore	Backups
MongoDB Atlas	Cloud hosting + monitoring
mongostat / mongotop	Real-time performance metrics
Change Streams	Track real-time data updates
Cloud Backups	Automated snapshot recovery

Example backup:

mongodump --db app_db --out /backups/app_db_2025/


⸻

12️⃣ Integration with Base44 Ecosystem

Layer	MongoDB Role
Supabase / SQL Layer	SQL for structured, relational data
MongoDB	Flexible NoSQL document layer
React / Next.js	API consumption via Express or Flask
Python / Flask / Django	Backend ORM (PyMongo, Motor)
TypeScript / Node.js	Backend API & schema validation
Roo Code / Cursor / Copilot	Schema and query autogeneration
Tempo / Ellipsis	Documentation and analytics logging
Base44 Core	Unified architectural data governance


⸻

13️⃣ Common Anti-Patterns

❌ Embedding entire documents when referencing is cleaner
❌ Ignoring indexes on large collections
❌ Storing inconsistent field types (age as both int and string)
❌ Overusing $lookup (inefficient joins)
❌ Missing createdAt / updatedAt fields
❌ Using eval() or $where
❌ Unbounded array growth in a single document

⸻

14️⃣ Best Practices Summary

✅ Design documents around query patterns
✅ Index early, test often
✅ Keep collections small and specific
✅ Embed small sub-documents; reference large relations
✅ Validate schemas for consistency
✅ Secure all endpoints and sanitize inputs
✅ Use Aggregation Framework for analytics
✅ Use transactions for multi-write operations
✅ Backup regularly
✅ Monitor query plans

⸻

15️⃣ Example Cheat Sheet

Find Documents

db.products.find({ price: { $gt: 50 } }).sort({ price: -1 }).limit(10);

Aggregation Example

db.sales.aggregate([
  { $match: { region: "US" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$product", totalSales: { $sum: "$amount" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSales: -1 } }
]);

Update with Array

db.users.updateOne(
  { _id: userId },
  { $push: { notifications: { message: "Welcome!", read: false } } }
);

🎨 Canva Design Standards

(General-Purpose Professional Reference for Visual Design & Content Creation)

⸻

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	Design with intent, not decoration.
Every Canva design — whether it’s a presentation, social media post, or brand asset — should communicate a clear message with consistent visual logic.
	•	Brand-first, style-second.
Fonts, colors, and layouts should follow your established design system or brand kit — not personal taste.
	•	Reusability > Reinvention.
Templates, styles, and design elements should be created for long-term reuse across campaigns and products.
	•	Clarity = Professionalism.
Keep spacing clean, type hierarchy clear, and color usage minimal for maximum readability.

⸻

	•	For accessibility, ensure color contrast meets WCAG AA (4.5:1) where applicable.

⸻

6️⃣ Imagery & Media

📷 Images
	•	Use high-resolution (≥1080p) and royalty-free images.
	•	Crop strategically — focus on faces, hands, or key product features.
	•	Avoid watermarked or pixelated visuals.

🎞 Videos & Motion
	•	Use short loops (3–10 seconds) for motion graphics.
	•	Keep transitions subtle (fade, slide, scale).
	•	Avoid excessive motion that distracts from content.

🧩 Icons & Illustrations
	•	Maintain consistent icon style (outlined, filled, or flat).
	•	Match stroke width and color with typography and layout.
	•	Use SVGs when possible for scalability.

⸻

7️⃣ Typography Standards

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎨 Figma Design Standards

(General-Purpose Professional Reference)

⸻

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	Figma is your visual source of truth.
Every UI element, color, and layout should exist in Figma before it exists in code.
	•	Consistency = Scalability.
Components, text styles, and spacing tokens should be unified across all screens to make design predictable and maintainable.
	•	Design once, reuse forever.
Use Figma Components, Variants, and Auto Layouts to ensure visual and behavioral consistency throughout the product.
	•	Design is a conversation.
Every Figma file should include annotations, comments, and rationale so developers and stakeholders understand why design decisions were made.

⸻

2️⃣ Workspace & File Structure

Maintain a clear and standardized folder structure in your Figma workspace:

📁 Project Name
 ┣ 🧭 01 - Foundations
 ┃  ┣ Colors
 ┃  ┣ Typography
 ┃  ┣ Icons
 ┃  ┣ Spacing & Grids
 ┃  ┗ Shadows / Elevation
 ┣ 🧩 02 - Components
 ┃  ┣ Buttons
 ┃  ┣ Inputs & Forms
 ┃  ┣ Modals / Cards
 ┃  ┣ Navigation
 ┃  ┗ Alerts & Toasts
 ┣ 📱 03 - Screens
 ┃  ┣ Onboarding
 ┃  ┣ Dashboard
 ┃  ┣ Profile / Settings
 ┃  ┗ Misc Screens
 ┣ 📊 04 - Prototypes
 ┗ 📝 05 - Documentation

Folder Guidelines
	•	Foundations: Visual tokens and grids — the “design language.”
	•	Components: Atomic elements and reusable patterns.
	•	Screens: Full-page mockups with component instances.
	•	Prototypes: Interactive user flows with transitions and logic.
	•	Documentation: Notes, links, design tokens, and changelogs.

⸻

3️⃣ Design System Foundations

🎨 Colors
	•	Define tokens in Figma Variables:
	•	--color-primary, --color-secondary, --color-bg, --color-text
	•	Include semantic naming (e.g., --color-success, --color-error).
	•	Document light/dark mode variations.
	•	Store gradients and overlays as reusable styles.

✍ Typography
	•	Set Text Styles for:
	•	Headings (H1–H6)
	•	Body (Body/Regular, Body/Medium)
	•	Caption & Label (Small, Overline)
	•	Use rem-scaled sizes for web parity.
	•	Align font weights to your code tokens (e.g., Tailwind font weights).

⚙ Spacing & Grid
	•	Establish an 8px or 4px spacing system.
	•	Use Auto Layout instead of manual pixel positioning.
	•	Define grids for common breakpoints:
	•	Mobile: 4–6 columns
	•	Tablet: 8 columns
	•	Desktop: 12 columns

🧱 Shadows & Borders
	•	Create Elevation tokens: elevation-1, elevation-2, etc.
	•	Maintain consistent corner radii (radius-sm, radius-md, radius-lg).

⸻

4️⃣ Component Standards

🧩 Components vs. Instances
	•	Master Components: Stored in the Components library.
	•	Instances: Used in actual screen designs. Avoid detaching unless necessary.

🔁 Variants

Use Variants for components that share a base but differ slightly:
	•	Buttons (Primary, Secondary, Ghost, Disabled)
	•	Inputs (Focused, Error, Success)
	•	Toggles (On, Off)
	•	Cards (With Image, Text Only)

⚡ Auto Layout
	•	Always use Auto Layout for containers, buttons, and cards.
	•	Configure padding, alignment, and distribution explicitly.
	•	Use Hug contents for dynamic text or inputs.

🔗 Constraints
	•	Define horizontal/vertical constraints for responsive behavior.
	•	Test resizing on mobile, tablet, and desktop frames.

⸻

5️⃣ Prototyping & Interaction

🧭 Navigation
	•	Use Prototype Links to simulate navigation between screens.
	•	Group related flows: onboarding, checkout, profile edit, etc.

🎬 Animation
	•	Keep animations subtle and meaningful.
	•	Use:
	•	Smart Animate for transitions.
	•	Instant for state changes.
	•	After Delay for auto-progress steps.
	•	Document motion easing and duration tokens (e.g., ease-in-out 200ms).

🪄 Interaction Logic
	•	Add interactive components for toggles, dropdowns, and tabs.
	•	Use “Component Properties” for dynamic states instead of duplicate components.

⸻

6️⃣ Collaboration & Handoff

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Design–Dev Workflow
	•	Developers should inspect elements directly in Figma to read:
	•	Spacing
	•	Colors
	•	Font styles
	•	Border radius and shadow values

🔍 Handoff Checklist

✅ All components are instances (not detached)
✅ Frames are organized and named logically
✅ Text styles, colors, and spacing use tokens
✅ Responsive behavior tested
✅ Notes and annotations present

📎 Dev Mode
	•	Use Figma Dev Mode for handoff:
	•	Copy CSS, Tailwind, or code snippets directly.
	•	Sync component properties to maintain parity with code.

⸻

7️⃣ Version Control
	•	Maintain version history for every major design milestone.
	•	Use branches for new features; merge once approved.
	•	Add changelog comments: “Updated primary button radius from 6px → 8px.”
	•	Use file naming conventions:

v1.0_Initial_Design
v1.1_Accessibility_Update
v2.0_Rebrand



⸻

8️⃣ Accessibility Guidelines
	•	Minimum text contrast: AA (4.5:1)
	•	Include focus/hover states for interactive components.
	•	Avoid color-only cues — pair with icons or text.
	•	Ensure target size ≥ 44px for buttons and controls.
	•	Provide alt text for images in annotations.

⸻

9️⃣ Plugins & Integrations

Recommended Plugins

Plugin	Purpose
Autoflow	Connect user flows automatically

⸻

🔟 File Hygiene

✅ Name every frame and component logically (Button/Primary/Default).
✅ Use emoji or prefix categories (🧭 Nav/Topbar, 🧩 Button/Primary).
✅ Remove hidden layers and unused components.
✅ Keep color/style libraries linked, not duplicated.
✅ Regularly clean unused variables and variants.

⸻

11️⃣ Documentation & Annotation

⸻

4️⃣ Basic Syntax Overview

Hello World

<?php
echo "Hello, Base44!";
?>

Variables

$name = "Ahnaf";
$age = 25;
$isAdmin = true;

Functions

function greet($name) {
  return "Hello, $name!";
}

echo greet("Ishmam");

Arrays

$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
  echo $fruit;
}


⸻

5️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Classes & Objects

class User {
  public $name;
  public $email;

  public function __construct($name, $email) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->email = $email;
  }

  public function greet() {
    return "Welcome, {$this->name}";
  }
}

$user = new User("Ahnaf", "a@example.com");
echo $user->greet();

Inheritance

class Admin extends User {
  public function hasPermission() {
    return true;
  }
}

Interfaces & Traits

interface Notifiable {
  public function notify($message);
}

trait Loggable {
  public function log($msg) {
    echo "Log: $msg";
  }
}

class EmailUser implements Notifiable {
  use Loggable;

  public function notify($message) {
    $this->log("Sending email: $message");
  }
}


⸻

6️⃣ Namespaces & Autoloading

namespace App\Services;

class PaymentService {
  public function process() {
    return "Processing payment...";
  }
}

Autoload via Composer:

composer dump-autoload

In composer.json:

"autoload": {
  "psr-4": {
    "App\\": "app/"
  }
}


⸻

7️⃣ Composer — Dependency Management

Command	Purpose
composer init	Initialize new project
composer install	Install dependencies
composer require package/name	Add dependency
composer update	Update all packages
composer dump-autoload	Rebuild autoloader

Example composer.json:

{
  "require": {

  }
}


⸻

8️⃣ Error Handling & Exceptions

Try / Catch

try {
  $result = 10 / 0;
} catch (DivisionByZeroError $e) {
  echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
} finally {
  echo "Execution complete.";
}

Custom Exception

class InvalidInputException extends Exception {}

throw new InvalidInputException("Invalid value provided.");


⸻

9️⃣ File Handling

$file = fopen("data.txt", "r");
while(!feof($file)) {
  echo fgets($file);
}
fclose($file);

Or using modern file helpers:

$content = file_get_contents("data.txt");
file_put_contents("output.txt", strtoupper($content));


⸻

🔟 Forms & Request Handling

Example:

if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
  $username = $_POST['username'];
  echo "Welcome, $username!";
}

Security Tip: Always sanitize:

$username = htmlspecialchars($_POST['username'], ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');


⸻

11️⃣ Working with Databases

PDO (Native)

$pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=localhost;dbname=test', 'root', '');
$stmt = $pdo->prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?');
$stmt->execute([1]);
$user = $stmt->fetch();

Laravel ORM (Eloquent)

User::where('active', 1)->get();

Migrations

php artisan make:migration create_users_table
php artisan migrate


⸻

12️⃣ APIs and JSON

JSON Handling

$data = ["name" => "Ahnaf", "age" => 25];
$json = json_encode($data);
echo $json;

API Response (Laravel style)

return response()->json([
  'status' => 'success',
  'data' => $user
]);

RESTful Routing (Laravel)

Route::get('/users', [UserController::class, 'index']);
Route::post('/users', [UserController::class, 'store']);


⸻

13️⃣ Frameworks Overview

Framework	Purpose
Laravel	Full-stack MVC + Eloquent ORM

  }
}


⸻

14️⃣ Authentication & Security

✅ Always hash passwords:

$password = password_hash('secret', PASSWORD_BCRYPT);
if (password_verify('secret', $password)) echo "Valid!";

✅ Use .env for secrets (never commit to Git):
✅ Enable CSRF tokens in forms
✅ Validate and sanitize input
✅ Use HTTPS
✅ Escape output before rendering HTML

⸻

15️⃣ Testing

Tool	Description
PHPUnit	Unit testing framework
Pest	Modern BDD-style testing

	•	Keep functions short and focused (< 50 lines)
	•	Use type hints and return types:

function add(int $a, int $b): int {
  return $a + $b;
}


	•	Use docblocks for all public methods:

/**
 * Send an email notification
 * @param string $recipient
 * @return bool
 */
public function sendEmail(string $recipient): bool { ... }



⸻

Convention:
	•	Code is organized by responsibility, not type.
	•	Use internal/ for private packages and pkg/ for reusable libraries.
	•	Entry points live in cmd/<appname>/main.go.

⸻

4️⃣ Basic Syntax Overview

Hello World

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Base44!")
}

Variables and Types

var name string = "Ahnaf"
age := 25 // Short declaration
const PI = 3.14159

Functions

func add(a int, b int) int {
    return a + b
}

func greet(name string) (string, error) {
    if name == "" {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("empty name")
    }
    return "Hello, " + name, nil
}


⸻

5️⃣ Control Structures

for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
    fmt.Println(i)
}

if age >= 18 {
    fmt.Println("Adult")
} else {
    fmt.Println("Minor")
}

switch day := "Monday"; day {
case "Monday":
    fmt.Println("Start strong!")
default:
    fmt.Println("Rest day")
}


⸻

6️⃣ Structs and Interfaces

Structs

type User struct {
    ID    int
    Name  string
    Email string
}

user := User{ID: 1, Name: "Ahnaf", Email: "a@example.com"}
fmt.Println(user.Name)

Methods

func (u *User) Greet() string {
    return "Hi, " + u.Name
}

Interfaces

type Notifier interface {
    Notify() string
}

type EmailUser struct {
    Email string
}

func (e EmailUser) Notify() string {
    return "Email sent to " + e.Email
}


⸻

Command	Description
go mod init module/name	Initialize module
go get <pkg>	Add dependency
go mod tidy	Clean unused imports
go build	Compile binary
go run main.go	Run program
go test ./...	Run all tests

Example module:

module github.com/ahnafishmam/base44

go 1.23
require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1
)


⸻

8️⃣ Concurrency (Goroutines & Channels)

Goroutines

func printMessage(msg string) {
    fmt.Println(msg)
}

func main() {
    go printMessage("Concurrent message")
    fmt.Println("Main thread running")
}

Channels

ch := make(chan string)

go func() {
    ch <- "Hello from goroutine"
}()

msg := <-ch
fmt.Println(msg)

Buffered Channels

ch := make(chan int, 2)
ch <- 1
ch <- 2
fmt.Println(<-ch)
fmt.Println(<-ch)

Rule of thumb: Use channels to communicate, not to share memory.

⸻

9️⃣ Error Handling

Go encourages explicit error handling instead of exceptions.

result, err := divide(10, 2)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
fmt.Println("Result:", result)

Custom errors:

var ErrInvalidInput = errors.New("invalid input")

func process(input int) error {
    if input <= 0 {
        return ErrInvalidInput
    }
    return nil
}


⸻

🔟 HTTP Server (Standard Library Example)

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintln(w, "Welcome to Base44 API")
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}


⸻

11️⃣ Web Frameworks

Framework	Purpose
Gin	Lightweight web framework for APIs
Echo	High-performance REST framework
Fiber	Express.js-style simplicity
Chi	Minimal router with middlewares
Beego	Enterprise MVC framework

Example using Gin:

r := gin.Default()

r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {
    c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "pong"})
})

r.Run(":8080")


⸻

12️⃣ Database Access

Using database/sql with PostgreSQL

import (
    "database/sql"
    _ "github.com/lib/pq"
)

db, err := sql.Open("postgres", "postgres://user:pass@localhost/db?sslmode=disable")
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer db.Close()

Using GORM (ORM)

import "gorm.io/gorm"

type Product struct {
    gorm.Model
    Name  string
    Price float64
}

db.Create(&Product{Name: "Phone", Price: 299.99})


⸻

13️⃣ JSON and Struct Tags

JSON Encoding/Decoding

type Book struct {
    Title  string json:"title"
    Author string json:"author"
}

b := Book{"Go in Action", "John Doe"}
jsonData, _ := json.Marshal(b)
fmt.Println(string(jsonData))

Decode

var book Book
json.Unmarshal([]byte({"title":"Go","author":"Ishmam"}), &book)


⸻

14️⃣ Testing

Tool	Purpose
testing package	Standard test runner
testify	Assertions and mocks
benchmarks	Performance testing

Unit Test Example

func Add(a, b int) int { return a + b }

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    got := Add(2, 3)
    want := 5
    if got != want {
        t.Errorf("got %d, want %d", got, want)
    }
}

Benchmark Example

func BenchmarkAdd(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        Add(2, 3)
    }
}

Run all:

go test ./... -v
go test -bench=.


⸻

15️⃣ Security & Best Practices

✅ Avoid global variables — prefer dependency injection.
✅ Validate inputs before processing.
✅ Use context (context.Context) for cancellation/timeouts.
✅ Hash passwords using bcrypt.
✅ Log safely — never print secrets.
✅ Use HTTPS and secure headers.
✅ Handle panics with recovery.
✅ Always close channels and DB connections.

Example timeout:

ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
defer cancel()


⸻

16️⃣ Performance Optimization

Area	Tip
Memory	Reuse slices and structs.
Concurrency	Avoid blocking goroutines.
GC Tuning	Keep object lifetime short.

⸻

19️⃣ Common Anti-Patterns

❌ Ignoring err returns
❌ Blocking on goroutines without sync (WaitGroup)
❌ Using global mutable state
❌ Ignoring context.Context
❌ Writing to closed channels
❌ Not deferring file or connection closures
❌ Mixing I/O and computation in the same function

⸻

20️⃣ Style & Conventions
	•	Follow Effective Go and Go Code Review Comments guides.
	•	Always run:

go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run


	•	Naming:
	•	Packages: lowercase, no underscores (user, not user_service)
	•	Functions/Vars: camelCase
	•	Constants: PascalCase or ALL_CAPS
	•	Keep functions small (<50 lines).
	•	Keep files focused on one purpose.
	•	Use doc comments (// FunctionName does...) before exports.

Example:

// CalculateInterest computes compound interest.
func CalculateInterest(principal, rate float64, years int) float64 {
    return principal * math.Pow(1+rate/100, float64(years))
}


⸻

21️⃣ Summary Principles

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🗄 SQL Standards

(General-Purpose Database Design & Querying Guide)

⸻

1️⃣ Core Philosophy
	•	SQL = Structure + Integrity + Logic.
It’s the foundation of persistent data — how apps remember, query, and connect information.
	•	Goal: Write secure, performant, and readable SQL that scales with your application.
	•	Principle: Treat your database schema as part of your application logic, not just storage.

“The best SQL isn’t the shortest — it’s the most understandable.”

⸻

2️⃣ SQL Fundamentals

Concept	Description	Example
Database	Logical collection of data	CREATE DATABASE app_db;
Table	Structured set of rows and columns	CREATE TABLE users (...);
Row (Record)	A single entry in a table	(1, 'Ahnaf', 'ishmam@email.com')
Column (Field)	Defines data type per attribute	id INT, name TEXT
Primary Key	Unique identifier for each record	PRIMARY KEY (id)
Foreign Key	References another table’s key	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
Index	Speeds up searches	CREATE INDEX idx_users_email ON users(email);
View	Virtual table from a query	CREATE VIEW active_users AS SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = true;


⸻

3️⃣ Data Types (Generalized Across Engines)

Category	Common Types	Example
Numeric	INT, BIGINT, DECIMAL, FLOAT	price DECIMAL(10,2)
Text	VARCHAR(n), TEXT, CHAR(n)	username VARCHAR(50)
Boolean	BOOLEAN	active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true
Date/Time	DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL	created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
UUID	Universally unique ID	id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()
JSON	Structured data (Postgres)	metadata JSONB
Binary	BYTEA, BLOB	image BYTEA

Always choose specific data types — they improve performance and validation.

⸻

4️⃣ Naming Conventions

Entity	Convention	Example
Tables	snake_case plural	users, order_items
Columns	snake_case	created_at, user_id
Primary Key	id	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
Foreign Key	<related_table>_id	user_id
Constraints	table_column_constraint	users_email_key
Indexes	idx_<table>_<column>	idx_users_email
Views	v_<description>	v_active_users
Functions	fn_<action>_<subject>	fn_calculate_total


⸻

5️⃣ Schema Design Principles

✅ Normalize (1NF → 3NF)
→ Eliminate redundancy, store each fact once.

✅ Use Foreign Keys
→ Enforce relational integrity between tables.

✅ Use Proper Data Types
→ Avoid oversized text fields for small data.

✅ Add Indexes
→ For columns frequently used in WHERE, JOIN, or ORDER BY.

✅ Denormalize when necessary
→ For reporting tables or read-heavy systems.

✅ Timestamps Everywhere
→ Always track created_at, updated_at, deleted_at when relevant.

✅ Soft Deletes
→ Use boolean or timestamp column (deleted_at) instead of hard deletes for traceability.

✅ Audit Trail
→ Maintain user activity, updates, and version history when needed.

⸻

6️⃣ CRUD Operations

CREATE

INSERT INTO users (name, email, active)
VALUES ('Ahnaf Ishmam', 'ahnaf@email.com', true);

READ

SELECT id, name, email
FROM users
WHERE active = true
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

UPDATE

UPDATE users
SET active = false
WHERE id = 3;

DELETE (Soft Delete Preferred)

UPDATE users
SET deleted_at = NOW()
WHERE id = 3;


⸻

7️⃣ Query Formatting Standards
	•	Uppercase for keywords: SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY.
	•	Lowercase for table and column names.
	•	Align clauses vertically for readability.
	•	Always terminate with ;.

Example:

SELECT
  u.id,
  u.name,
  COUNT(o.id) AS order_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN orders o
  ON o.user_id = u.id
WHERE u.active = TRUE
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY order_count DESC;


⸻

8️⃣ Joins Overview

Type	Purpose	Example
INNER JOIN	Only matching rows	FROM users u INNER JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
LEFT JOIN	All from left + matches	FROM users u LEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
RIGHT JOIN	All from right + matches	FROM orders o RIGHT JOIN users u ON u.id = o.user_id
FULL OUTER JOIN	All rows, with NULLs	FROM users u FULL JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id
CROSS JOIN	Cartesian product	FROM a CROSS JOIN b

Use LEFT JOIN most often; it’s the safest for preserving data visibility.

⸻

9️⃣ Aggregation & Grouping

SELECT
  department,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
  AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

Rules:
	•	Use HAVING for conditions on aggregates.
	•	Always group all non-aggregated columns.
	•	Prefer window functions (OVER()) for advanced analytics.

Example (window function):

SELECT
  user_id,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY created_at) AS running_total
FROM transactions;


⸻

🔟 Indexing & Optimization

Technique	Purpose
B-Tree Indexes	Default, good for most lookups
GIN/GIST Indexes	For JSON, text search
Composite Indexes	Multi-column lookups
Partial Indexes	Conditional indexing
Unique Indexes	Prevent duplicates

Example:

CREATE INDEX idx_orders_user_status
ON orders (user_id, status);

Best Practices:

✅ Don’t over-index — each index costs insert/update performance.
✅ Analyze queries with EXPLAIN ANALYZE.
✅ Use caching at app level for frequently run queries.

⸻

11️⃣ Constraints & Data Integrity

Type	Example	Purpose
PRIMARY KEY	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY	Uniquely identifies records
FOREIGN KEY	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)	Enforces relationships
UNIQUE	UNIQUE (email)	Prevents duplicates
CHECK	CHECK (age >= 18)	Ensures valid data
DEFAULT	created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()	Auto-filled values
NOT NULL	email TEXT NOT NULL	Prevents missing data


⸻

12️⃣ Transactions

Wrap related operations atomically:

BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;

If error:

ROLLBACK;

Always use transactions for multi-step writes (money, inventory, or data consistency).

⸻

13️⃣ Views & Materialized Views

Regular View

CREATE VIEW v_active_customers AS
SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE active = TRUE;

Materialized View

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales_summary AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(total) AS total_sales
FROM orders
GROUP BY product_id;

Refresh materialized views periodically:

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_sales_summary;


⸻

14️⃣ Stored Procedures & Functions

Type	Purpose
Function	Returns a value
Procedure	Executes logic without return

Example:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_full_name(uid INT)
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
  SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name FROM users WHERE id = uid;
$$ LANGUAGE SQL;

Keep logic simple — use app code for complex operations.

⸻

15️⃣ Security & Permissions

Practice	Example
Least Privilege Principle	Create limited roles
Role Grants	Assign specific permissions
Revoke Defaults	Limit unwanted access
RLS (Row-Level Security)	Fine-grained access

Always manage users with separate roles:
	•	admin: Full access.
	•	app_user: Read/write.
	•	readonly: Read-only queries.

⸻

16️⃣ Backup & Migration

Task	Tool
Backup	pg_dump, mysqldump
Migration	Django ORM, Alembic, Prisma, Flyway
Restore	psql < backup.sql

Example:

pg_dump -U postgres mydb > backup.sql
psql -U postgres -d mydb -f backup.sql

Automate nightly backups for production databases.

⸻

17️⃣ Testing & Debugging

Method	Tool
Query Plan	EXPLAIN, EXPLAIN ANALYZE
Schema Testing	SQLFluff, pgTAP
Data Validation	Check constraints
Logs	Enable log_statement = 'all' (Postgres)


⸻

18️⃣ Integration with Base44 Ecosystem

Layer	SQL Role
Supabase	Core Postgres layer with RLS & auth
React / Next.js	Frontend consumes REST/RPC endpoints
Python / Django / Flask	ORM abstraction (query builder)
TypeScript / Prisma	Schema synchronization
Roo Code / Cursor / Copilot	Auto-generate SQL queries
Tempo / Ellipsis	Query journaling & audit logs
Base44 Docs	Stores schema definitions & policies


⸻

19️⃣ Common Anti-Patterns

❌ Using SELECT * in production
❌ No WHERE clause in destructive queries
❌ Over-indexing small tables
❌ Storing JSON when relational tables suffice
❌ Ignoring constraints
❌ Mixing business logic inside triggers excessively
❌ Not using transactions for multi-step updates
❌ Ignoring timezone in datetime fields

⸻

20️⃣ Summary Principles

✅ Design with normalization, read/write balance in mind
✅ Index intentionally, not excessively
✅ Document every table and relationship
✅ Enforce integrity via constraints
✅ Use transactions for critical operations
✅ Secure access with roles and RLS
✅ Back up and monitor regularly
✅ Integrate SQL with app logic cleanly and safely
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cursor Development Standards

1) Core Principles
	•	Human sets direction, AI does labor. You own intent, acceptance criteria, and review. Cursor generates diffs that you approve.
	•	Work in small, verifiable steps. Each AI edit should be reviewable, testable, and revertible.
	•	Codify the rules in repo. Keep a project-level rules file so the AI follows your conventions automatically.
	•	Determinism > creativity for code. Prefer explicit instructions, constraints, and tests to “make it nice.”

⸻

2) Workspace Setup
	•	Recommended files (commit to repo):
	•	/.cursorrules – project rules for code style, folder structure, naming, stack (see template below).
	•	/docs/* – your other standards (React, Next.js, TS, Tailwind, Supabase, HTML, VS Code).
	•	CONTRIBUTING.md – how to run, test, lint, and ship.
	•	package.json scripts – make common tasks discoverable (build/test/lint/dev/format).
	•	Context hygiene: Keep the repo small and focused; exclude huge assets and generated files (.next, dist, coverage, *.lock.old) so AI context stays relevant.

⸻

3) Daily Workflow in Cursor

A) Plan → Edit → Test loop
	1.	Create a tiny plan in Chat
	•	Describe goal, constraints, acceptance tests.
	•	Ask Cursor to list files to touch and risk items.
	2.	Run /edit (Inline Edit) on the smallest unit (one file/feature).
	3.	Inspect the diff carefully.
	•	Reject if it violates your standards or adds scope.
	4.	Run tests/lint locally (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+B or task).
	5.	Iterate or commit. Commit small, atomic changes.

B) When to use which feature
	•	Chat: Planning, multi-file refactors, questions, generating test cases, architecture guidance.
	•	Inline Edit (/edit): Precise changes in the open file or selection (best for code).
	•	Composer/Agent: Larger multi-file changes; watch out for scope creep—feed it a plan + acceptance tests first.
	•	Terminal (inside Cursor): Run your scripts/tests; paste failures back to Chat for fixes.

⸻

4) Prompt Patterns (copy-paste templates)

4.1 High-level feature plan

Goal
Add [feature] with [tech]. Keep current behavior intact.

Context
- Stack: Next.js App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind (cva), Supabase (RLS), React standards.

Deliverables
- Files to change/add with reasons
- Minimal schema changes (if any)
- API contracts (types)
- Risk list + rollback plan

Acceptance Tests
- [Given] [When] [Then] …

4.2 Precise inline edit (/edit in a file or selection)

Task: Modify only this component to add [X]. 
Constraints:
- Follow project React standards (named exports, interface above component, Tailwind classes).
- No extra dependencies.
- Keep existing props API stable.

Acceptance:
- Builds with pnpm build
- Unit test passes [link to test] 
- TypeScript: no new any

4.3 Refactor without behavior change

Refactor for readability and performance. 
Do NOT change runtime behavior or public types.
- Extract pure helpers
- Remove duplication
- Keep coverage the same or add tests if needed

4.4 Test-first fix

Here is a failing test output: 
[PASTE FAILURE LOG]

Write the minimal code changes to make this test pass. 
Explain root cause in 2 bullets.

4.5 Migration guard (DB or API)

We need a migration for [X]. 
- Output forward + rollback SQL
- List RLS/policy impacts
- Provide data backfill script
- Provide smoke test query


⸻

5) Good “Cursor Rules” file

Create /.cursorrules in the repo root:

# Cursor Repo Rules

## Coding Style & Stack
- TypeScript strict. No any unless justified with a comment.
- React: named exports; default export only for Next.js pages.
- Props: define interface directly above component.
- Import order: React, external libs, internal modules, assets/styles.
- Styling: Tailwind via className; use clsx/cva for variants; avoid inline styles.
- Next.js App Router conventions: app/ routing, Server Components by default; Client with 'use client'.
- Supabase: use RLS; do not commit service role keys; migrations via SQL files only.

## Collaboration Rules
- Work in small PRs (<300 lines diff).
- Include Acceptance Criteria + before/after screenshots for UI.
- Update docs when adding new patterns.

## AI Behavior
- Prefer minimal diffs; do not reformat unrelated lines.
- Never introduce new dependencies without approval.
- Keep functions pure when possible; isolate side effects.
- Generate/modify tests alongside code changes.
- If unsure, ask for clarification instead of guessing.

Cursor will read this automatically and follow the rules while editing.

⸻

6) Multi-file Changes Safely
	•	Ask Chat to list the files it plans to edit and why. Confirm or prune.
	•	Use batch edits only after you’ve validated a single-file spike.
	•	If it touches config (tsconfig, eslint, tailwind), demand a reason and a rollback snippet.

⸻

7) Keeping the AI on Rails
	•	Pin constraints at the top of each prompt (stack, style, no deps, tests required).
	•	Give concrete examples (existing components, utility functions).
	•	Provide failing tests or logs—the best way to force minimal, correct fixes.
	•	Reject creative rewrites of working code unless you asked for a refactor.

⸻

8) Git Hygiene with Cursor
	•	Enable “show diff” always; scan for:
	•	Hidden logic changes
	•	Unnecessary renames
	•	Deleted comments/docs
	•	Commit messages: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, refactor:).
	•	One logical change per commit; tests in the same commit when possible.

⸻

9) Security & Secrets
	•	Never paste service keys or private tokens into Chat.
	•	Redact logs and environment values before sharing.
	•	For Supabase: limit changes to RLS/Policies; never output service key usage in client code.

⸻

10) Quality Gates (what to ask Cursor to produce)
	•	Types: No any/unknown escaping; exported types documented.
	•	Tests: Ask for unit tests or integration tests (Vitest/Jest/Playwright) with clear arrange/act/assert.
	•	Docs: Short docstring or README snippet for new modules.
	•	Performance: For hot paths, request complexity note and micro-benchmark if relevant.

⸻

11) Useful Commands / Shortcuts (common defaults)
	•	Chat: Cmd/Ctrl + L (open), @file.ts to attach files.
	•	Inline Edit: select code → type /edit → enter instruction.
	•	Quick Fix: hover diagnostic → suggested edit.
	•	Terminal: open integrated terminal in Cursor for build/test.
	•	Ask on Error: copy stack trace → paste into Chat with “make minimal fix.”

(Your exact keybindings may vary; check Cursor’s Command Palette.)

⸻

12) Example End-to-End Session (mini)
	1.	Prompt (Chat)
“Add POST /api/subscribe that validates email, inserts into subscribers, sends a welcome email. No new deps. Acceptance: 201 on success; 400 invalid email; unit tests.”
	2.	Cursor outputs plan
	•	src/pages/api/subscribe.ts
	•	src/lib/validateEmail.ts
	•	_tests_/subscribe.test.ts
	3.	Run /edit in subscribe.ts to implement minimal version.
	4.	Run tests; paste any failures; ask Cursor to fix only failing assertions.
	5.	Review diff, commit with feat(api): add subscribe endpoint.

⸻

13) Anti-patterns (what to push back on)
	•	Giant refactors that rename/format everything.
	•	Adding libraries for trivial tasks.
	•	Changing project configuration without a migration/rollback plan.
	•	Writing tests after a big change (do it alongside).
	•	Copying code blocks that violate your standards (naming, style, Tailwind, etc.).

⸻

14) Troubleshooting Cheats
	•	“Cursor keeps changing unrelated code” → Add rule “no reformat outside touched lines”, select exact range before /edit.
	•	“It proposes new deps” → Reply: “No new dependencies allowed. Rework with stdlib/existing utils.”
	•	“Output is too broad” → Ask: “Return only a diff with file paths and exact patches, no prose.”
	•	“It touches RLS/storage dangerously” → Force a read-only plan first: “List SQL to be changed; do not apply; include rollback.”

⸻

15) Quick Reference: Prompt Starters
	•	“Plan the minimal changes to implement X; list files to touch and tests to add.”
	•	“Edit only this file to fix Y; do not change interfaces or imports outside the selection.”
	•	“Add tests for Z; cover success, error, and edge cases; keep tests fast and deterministic.”
	•	“Explain this stack trace and suggest the smallest safe patch.”
	•	“Document this module with a short README and usage example.”

⸻

Optional: Project-specific addendum

Add a final section that links your other standards so Cursor learns them:
	•	React Component Standards
	•	Next.js App Router Patterns
	•	TypeScript Standards
	•	Tailwind Usage Guidelines
	•	Supabase Development Guidelines
	•	HTML Standards
	•	VS Code Standards

In practice, pasting those links (or brief summaries) into Chat at the start of a session greatly improves adherence.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HTML Development Standards

1. Core Principles
	•	Semantic structure:
Always use HTML elements for their intended purpose. The goal is clarity, accessibility, and SEO readability.
✅ Good example:

<header> ... </header>
<main> ... </main>
<footer> ... </footer>

❌ Bad example:

<div id="header"> ... </div>


	•	Separation of Concerns:
HTML handles structure, CSS handles style, JS handles behavior. Avoid inline styling or inline event handlers when possible.
	•	Accessibility first:
Every element should be usable with keyboard navigation, readable by screen readers, and compliant with WCAG guidelines.

⸻

2. Document Structure

Basic Template

Always start with a complete HTML5 skeleton.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta name="description" content="A modern, accessible web page." />
    <title>My App</title>

    <!-- Favicon -->
    <link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" />

    <!-- CSS and Fonts -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles.css" />
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <header>...</header>
    <main>...</main>
    <footer>...</footer>

    <script src="/main.js" defer></script>
  </body>
</html>

Key Points
	•	Use <!DOCTYPE html> to ensure standards mode.
	•	Use lang attribute for accessibility and SEO.
	•	Include <meta name="viewport"> for responsive design.
	•	Add a meaningful <title> per page.
	•	Keep scripts at the end of <body> or use defer for performance.

⸻

3. Semantic Layout Elements

Structural Tags

Tag	Purpose
<header>	Top section — logo, nav, intro
<nav>	Primary/secondary navigation
<main>	Main page content (one per page)
<section>	Logical grouping of content
<article>	Independent, reusable content (e.g., blog post, card)
<aside>	Related info (sidebar, tips, ads)
<footer>	Footer or closing notes
<figure> & <figcaption>	Images or diagrams with captions

Example:

<main>
  <article>
    <h1>Introduction to HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML is the structure of the web.</p>
  </article>
  <aside>
    <p>Tip: Use semantic tags for clarity.</p>
  </aside>
</main>


⸻

4. Headings & Text Content
	•	Headings (<h1>–<h6>) define content hierarchy.
	•	Each page should have only one <h1>.
	•	Use descending order (e.g., <h2> for subsections).
	•	Use <p> for paragraphs, <strong> for importance, <em> for emphasis.
	•	Use lists for related items:

<ul>
  <li>Feature 1</li>
  <li>Feature 2</li>
</ul>


	•	Use <blockquote> for quotes, <code> for code, <pre> for formatted text.

⸻

5. Forms & Inputs
	•	Always associate labels with inputs for accessibility.
	•	Use proper input types (email, password, number, date, etc.).
	•	Group related fields with <fieldset> and <legend>.
	•	Provide clear validation and instructions.

<form action="/submit" method="post">
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Sign Up</legend>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required />

    <label for="password">Password:</label>
    <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required />

    <button type="submit">Register</button>
  </fieldset>
</form>

✅ Tips:
	•	Always include name attributes for backend integration.
	•	Use aria-invalid="true" for error states.
	•	Use autocomplete for better UX.

⸻

6. Media Elements

Images
	•	Use alt attributes for accessibility.
	•	Prefer responsive images:

<img
  src="image-800.jpg"
  srcset="image-400.jpg 400w, image-800.jpg 800w, image-1200.jpg 1200w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 400px, 800px"
  alt="A scenic view"
/>


	•	Use <picture> for art direction:

<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Fallback image" />
</picture>



Video & Audio
	•	Always include controls and captions.

<video controls width="640" preload="metadata">
  <source src="/video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <track src="/captions.vtt" kind="captions" srclang="en" label="English" />
</video>



⸻

7. Accessibility (A11y)
	•	Always use semantic HTML before ARIA roles.
	•	Ensure keyboard navigability (tabindex, focus management).
	•	Use aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby only when necessary.
	•	Provide text alternatives for images, videos, and icons.
	•	Maintain color contrast ratios (minimum 4.5:1 for text).

✅ Example:

<button aria-label="Play video">
  <svg role="img" aria-hidden="true" ...></svg>
</button>


⸻

8. Performance Optimization
	•	Minimize HTML size by removing unnecessary whitespace/comments.
	•	Load CSS early (<link rel="stylesheet"> in <head>).
	•	Load JS late (defer or async).
	•	Use <link rel="preload"> for key assets (fonts, hero images).
	•	Use caching headers and a CDN for static files.

⸻

9. SEO & Metadata

Essential Meta Tags

<meta name="description" content="Your app description here." />
<meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Web Development" />
<meta name="author" content="Your Name" />
<meta property="og:title" content="My App" />
<meta property="og:description" content="An awesome web app." />
<meta property="og:image" content="/og-image.png" />
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />

SEO Checklist
	•	Use descriptive titles and headings.
	•	Include structured data (Schema.org) for key pages.
	•	Ensure URLs and navigation are crawlable.
	•	Avoid duplicate <h1> or missing <alt> tags.

⸻

10. Modern HTML Features

<template>

Reusable hidden markup for dynamic rendering.

<template id="card-template">
  <article class="card">
    <h2></h2>
    <p></p>
  </article>
</template>

<dialog>

Native modals with built-in accessibility.

<dialog id="infoDialog">
  <p>Form submitted successfully!</p>
  <button onclick="this.closest('dialog').close()">Close</button>
</dialog>

<details> & <summary>

Expandable sections:

<details>
  <summary>More info</summary>
  <p>This is additional content.</p>
</details>


⸻

11. Progressive Enhancement
	•	Ensure core content and functionality work without JavaScript.
	•	Load advanced features (animations, dynamic forms) progressively.
	•	Fallback gracefully with <noscript>:

<noscript>
  <p>This app requires JavaScript to function properly.</p>
</noscript>



⸻

12. File Organization

project/
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── css/
│   ├── main.css
│   └── variables.css
├── js/
│   ├── main.js
│   └── helpers.js
├── images/
│   └── logo.png
└── assets/

	•	Keep HTML pages minimal — use includes or templates for shared elements.
	•	Use consistent relative paths and lowercase filenames.

⸻

13. Testing & Validation
	•	Use W3C HTML Validator: https://validator.w3.org/
	•	Use Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools) for:
	•	Performance
	•	Accessibility
	•	Best Practices
	•	SEO
	•	Check responsiveness with different screen widths.

⸻

14. Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Missing alt attributes
❌ Using <div> for every layout block
❌ Multiple <h1> per page
❌ Inline CSS or JS without necessity
❌ Broken or unclosed tags
❌ Missing form labels
❌ Using tables for layout (use CSS Grid/Flexbox instead)

⸻

15. Summary Checklist

✅ Semantic structure (header, main, footer)
✅ Accessible labels & ARIA attributes
✅ Valid meta tags and viewport setup
✅ Optimized media loading
✅ Mobile-friendly responsive layout
✅ Tested with Lighthouse and validator
✅ Clean, consistent indentation and formatting
✅ No inline CSS or unnecessary <div>s
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supabase Development Standards

1. Project Setup & Environment
	•	Keys & Environment Variables
	•	NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL → Project URL (public)
	•	NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY → Client-side key (RLS enforced)
	•	SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY → Server-only key (bypasses RLS; never exposed to client)
	•	Store keys securely in .env.local, .env.production, etc.
	•	Environment Separation
	•	Use distinct Supabase projects for development, staging, and production.
	•	Maintain identical schemas across environments via migrations.
	•	SDK Configuration (Next.js Example)

import { createBrowserClient, createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr';

// Client (for browser interactions)
export const supabaseBrowser = () =>
  createBrowserClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
  );

// Server (for API routes, server components, or actions)
export const supabaseServer = (cookies: () => any) =>
  createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY!, // or anon if you prefer enforced RLS
    { cookies }
  );



⸻

2. Database Design Principles
	•	Naming Conventions
	•	Tables → snake_case and plural (e.g., user_profiles, orders, products)
	•	Columns → singular nouns (e.g., created_at, user_id)
	•	Avoid reserved keywords.
	•	Defaults & Timestamps

id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
created_at timestamptz default now(),
updated_at timestamptz default now()


	•	Relationships
	•	Always use foreign keys with on delete cascade.
	•	Add appropriate indexes for joins and sorting fields.
	•	Data Types
	•	Use uuid for identifiers.
	•	Use jsonb for flexible metadata.
	•	Prefer enum for fixed value sets (e.g., status, role).
	•	Version Control
	•	Use the Supabase CLI for migration scripts (supabase db diff, supabase db push).
	•	Commit migration SQL files into version control.

⸻

3. Authentication & Authorization
	•	Auth Providers
	•	Supabase Auth supports Email/Password, OAuth (Google, GitHub, etc.), Magic Links, and OTPs.
	•	Keep Auth settings consistent across environments.
	•	Profiles
	•	Link auth.users → public.profiles (1:1 relationship).
	•	Example:

create table public.profiles (
  id uuid primary key references auth.users on delete cascade,
  username text unique,
  avatar_url text,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);


	•	Access
	•	Client-side → use supabase.auth.getUser() or onAuthStateChange.
	•	Server-side → use the server client with cookies or tokens for verification.

⸻

4. Row-Level Security (RLS)
	•	Enable RLS

alter table public.users enable row level security;


	•	Policy Guidelines
	•	Keep one clear policy per command (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
	•	Use auth.uid() to scope data per authenticated user.
	•	Prefer EXISTS subqueries for relationships (fast & clear).
	•	Example

create policy "users: select own"
on public.users for select
using (id = auth.uid());

create policy "users: update own"
on public.users for update
using (id = auth.uid())
with check (id = auth.uid());


	•	Testing Policies
	•	Use Supabase SQL editor → “Run as → Authenticated User” to verify access.
	•	Ensure every RLS-enabled table has a valid SELECT policy for authorized roles.

⸻

5. Storage Management
	•	Buckets
	•	Use separate buckets per domain (e.g., avatars, uploads, documents).
	•	Mark as public only if intended for public access.
	•	Policies

create policy "Users can upload to their folder"
on storage.objects for insert to authenticated
with check (bucket_id = 'avatars' and (storage.foldername(name))[1] = auth.uid()::text);

create policy "Public can read avatars"
on storage.objects for select to public
using (bucket_id = 'avatars');


	•	Uploads (Client Example)

const filePath = ${user.id}/${Date.now()}-${file.name};
await supabase.storage.from('avatars').upload(filePath, file);


	•	Avoid
	•	Inline base64 images in tables.
	•	Unrestricted uploads (always define policies).

⸻

6. API, Functions, and Edge Actions
	•	Server Actions / Functions
	•	Use 'use server' in Next.js or call RPCs for atomic operations.
	•	Keep business logic centralized in SQL functions or Edge Functions for performance.

create or replace function increment_counter(user_id uuid)
returns void language sql as $$
  update public.profiles set login_count = login_count + 1 where id = user_id;
$$;

await supabase.rpc('increment_counter', { user_id: user.id });


	•	Edge Functions
	•	Use for async tasks, webhooks, or secure processing (Stripe, file parsing).
	•	Deploy with supabase functions deploy.

⸻

7. Realtime Subscriptions
	•	Setup
	•	Enable Realtime on target tables:

alter publication supabase_realtime add table public.orders;
alter table public.orders replica identity full;


	•	Client

const channel = supabase
  .channel('orders')
  .on('postgres_changes', { event: '*', schema: 'public', table: 'orders' }, payload => {
    console.log('Change received!', payload);
  })
  .subscribe();


	•	Common Uses
	•	Notifications, dashboards, live chat, analytics.
	•	Always filter events by schema/table for performance.

⸻

8. Caching & Performance
	•	Indexes
	•	Index frequent filters/sorts.
	•	Use composite indexes (e.g., (user_id, created_at desc)).
	•	Query Optimization
	•	Use explain analyze for profiling slow queries.
	•	Move complex joins into Postgres views or RPCs.
	•	Pagination
	•	Use limit + offset for small datasets.
	•	Use keyset pagination (> created_at) for real-time feeds.
	•	Data Archiving
	•	Create archived_* tables for inactive data to reduce index size.

⸻

9. Security Best Practices
	•	Keys
	•	Never expose service_role key to the frontend.
	•	Rotate keys regularly for production.
	•	CORS & Rate Limits
	•	Restrict origins in Supabase project settings.
	•	Apply rate limits via middleware or Edge Functions.
	•	Validation
	•	Validate input both client and server-side.
	•	Sanitize file uploads (types, sizes).
	•	Auditing
	•	Log significant mutations (insert/update/delete).
	•	Use pgcrypto for sensitive encryption where needed.

⸻

10. Local Development & CI/CD
	•	CLI
	•	supabase start → local dev
	•	supabase db push → apply migrations
	•	supabase stop → stop containers
	•	supabase functions serve → test Edge Functions locally
	•	CI/CD Practices
	•	Automate migration testing in CI (use test database).
	•	Use environment variables securely in deployment pipelines.

⸻

11. Observability & Maintenance
	•	Monitoring
	•	Use Supabase Dashboard for DB performance and logs.
	•	Monitor error rates, slow queries, and failed auth events.
	•	Backups
	•	Schedule automatic backups.
	•	Before major schema changes: pg_dump manually.
	•	Alerting
	•	Connect error monitoring (e.g., Sentry) to API/Edge endpoints.
	•	Use Supabase webhooks for auth or storage event notifications.

⸻

12. Deployment Checklist
	•	RLS enabled and tested for all sensitive tables.
	•	Indexes and foreign keys verified.
	•	Storage policies correctly scoped.
	•	Environment variables set correctly.
	•	Realtime enabled where needed.
	•	Database migrations versioned and deployed.
	•	Backups and rollback plan ready.

⸻

13. Troubleshooting Quick Reference

Issue	Common Cause	Fix
406 Not Acceptable	RLS blocked the query	Review USING and WITH CHECK
42501 must be owner	You’re not Owner for system table	Switch SQL Editor “Run as Owner”
Empty SELECT results	Missing SELECT policy	Add/select policy for authenticated
Realtime not firing	Table not in publication	alter publication supabase_realtime add table ...
File upload fails	Policy or path mismatch	Verify folder prefix matches auth.uid()
Slow queries	Missing index	Create index on filter/sort columns
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeScript Development Standards

1. Project Setup

Compiler Configuration (tsconfig.json)
	•	Always enable strict mode for maximum type safety.
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["DOM", "ESNext"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "noImplicitThis": true,
    "alwaysStrict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "incremental": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/": ["src/"]
    },
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "outDir": "dist"
  },
  "include": ["src", "next-env.d.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
Why strict mode matters:
It prevents silent bugs by forcing you to handle undefined, null, and type mismatches explicitly.

File Conventions
	•	Source code in /src.
	•	Use .ts for logic-only files, .tsx for files returning JSX.
	•	Keep types/ or @types/ folder for shared type definitions.
	•	Enable absolute imports (@/utils, @/components, etc.) using baseUrl + paths mapping.

⸻

2. Core Type System Guidelines

Prefer Explicit Types
	•	Always type function parameters and returns unless fully inferred.
function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}
Use Type Aliases and Interfaces Appropriately
	•	Interfaces: for structured data models or objects meant for extension.
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
Type aliases: for unions, primitives, or composition.
type Status = 'pending' | 'active' | 'archived';
type ID = string | number;
Extending interfaces:
interface Admin extends User {
  role: 'admin';
}
Use readonly and Partial for safer data contracts
interface Config {
  readonly appName: string;
  version: number;
  debug?: boolean;
}

const config: Readonly<Config> = { appName: 'MyApp', version: 1 };
3. Functions & Type Inference
	•	Prefer function declarations for reusability and hoisting:
export function calculateTotal(price: number, tax = 0.1): number {
  return price + price * tax;
}
Use arrow functions for callbacks and inline handlers:
const log = (msg: string): void => console.log(msg);
Leverage type inference:
const scores = [90, 80, 70]; // inferred as number[]
Use generics for reusable utilities:
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

const result = identity<string>('hello');
4. Data Structures and Collections
	•	Arrays
const names: string[] = ['Alice', 'Bob'];
	•	Tuples
const pair: [string, number] = ['Age', 30];
	•	Records
type CountryCodes = Record<string, string>;
const countries: CountryCodes = { US: 'United States', CA: 'Canada' };
	•	Maps & Sets
const idMap = new Map<number, string>();
idMap.set(1, 'Alice');
5. Generics and Utility Types

Generics

Use generics to write reusable, type-safe abstractions.
function getFirst<T>(arr: T[]): T | undefined {
  return arr[0];
}
Built-in Utility Types
Utility: Partial<T>  
Description: Makes all properties optional  
Example: Partial<User>
Utility: Required<T>  
Description: Makes all properties required  
Example: Required<User>
Utility: Pick<T, K>  
Description: Selects specific keys  
Example: Pick<User, 'id'>
Utility: Omit<T, K>  
Description: Removes specific keys  
Example: Omit<User, 'password'>
Utility: Record<K, T>  
Description: Creates a key-value map  
Example: Record<string, number>
Utility: Readonly<T>  
Description: Prevents modification  
Example: Readonly<User>
6. Error Handling & Type Safety
	•	Always narrow types before access:
function printId(id: string | number) {
  if (typeof id === 'string') {
    console.log(id.toUpperCase());
  } else {
    console.log(id.toFixed(2));
  }
}
	•	Handle optional values:
user?.profile?.email ?? 'no-email@example.com';
	•	Use discriminated unions for state handling:
type Result =
  | { status: 'success'; data: string }
  | { status: 'error'; error: Error };

function handleResult(r: Result) {
  if (r.status === 'success') console.log(r.data);
  else console.error(r.error);
}
7. Modules, Imports & Exports
	•	Import order:
	1.	Node/React
	2.	External libraries
	3.	Internal modules
	4.	Assets/styles
	•	Named exports preferred:
export interface User { ... }
export function fetchData() { ... }
	•	Default exports only for pages or single-purpose files.
export default function Page() { ... }
8. Async & Promises
	•	Use async/await instead of raw Promises.
async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<User> {
  const res = await fetch(/api/users/${id});
  return res.json();
}
	•	Handle errors gracefully:
try {
  const user = await fetchUser('1');
} catch (err: unknown) {
  if (err instanceof Error) console.error(err.message);
}
9. Type Guards & Assertions
	•	Type Guards:
function isUser(obj: any): obj is User {
  return obj && typeof obj.id === 'string' && typeof obj.name === 'string';
}
	•	Assertions (use sparingly):
const el = document.getElementById('root') as HTMLDivElement;
Avoid overusing as — prefer proper guards when possible.

⸻

10. Working with APIs
	•	Type your API responses explicitly
interface ApiResponse<T> {
  data: T;
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
}

async function fetchData<T>(url: string): Promise<ApiResponse<T>> {
  const res = await fetch(url);
  return res.json();
}
	•	Schema validation
Use zod, yup, or io-ts to validate runtime data.
import { z } from 'zod';

const UserSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid(),
  name: z.string(),
});

type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;
11. Tooling & Developer Experience
	•	Linting
	•	Use eslint with @typescript-eslint/parser.
	•	Extend recommended configs.
{
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended",
    "prettier"
  ]
}
	•	Formatting
	•	Use Prettier for consistent code style.
	•	Add "plugin:prettier/recommended" to ESLint config.
	•	Type Checking in CI
tsc --noEmit
Ensures type correctness without generating files.

⸻

12. Testing with TypeScript
	•	Use vitest or jest with ts-jest or @swc/jest.
	•	Write tests with explicit types:
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { sum } from '../utils/math';

describe('sum', () => {
  it('adds numbers correctly', () => {
    const result: number = sum(2, 3);
    expect(result).toBe(5);
  });
});
	•	Mock types with Partial<T> or jest.Mocked<T>.

⸻

13. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Using any too often
→ Use unknown when unsure, then narrow types later.
let value: unknown = getSomething();
if (typeof value === 'string') console.log(value);
❌ Implicit any
→ Add explicit types to function parameters.

❌ Circular imports
→ Break modules apart or extract shared types.

❌ Mixing JS & TS loosely
→ Rename files to .ts/.tsx and fix type issues incrementally.

⸻

14. Deployment & Build
	•	Run tsc --noEmit during builds to ensure no type errors.
	•	Use incremental builds for speed ("incremental": true).
	•	Generate declaration files for libraries:
{ "declaration": true, "emitDeclarationOnly": true }
	•	Use tsup, esbuild, or vite for fast bundling with TypeScript.

⸻

15. Summary Checklist

✅ Strict mode enabled
✅ No any or implicit types
✅ Explicitly typed API responses
✅ Linted and formatted code
✅ Type-safe props and states
✅ Runtime validation for external data
✅ Generic utilities for reusable patterns
✅ Tests type-checked and passing
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vite Development Standards

1) Project Setup
	•	Node & Package Manager
	•	Use LTS Node (≥18). Lock with .nvmrc or engines.
	•	Use pnpm or npm with a lockfile committed.
	•	Scaffolding
	•	pnpm create vite → pick framework + TS.
	•	Keep source under src/. Public static assets under /public.
	•	Scripts

{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "eslint .",
    "test": "vitest"
  }
}


	•	Directory Layout (suggested)

src/
  assets/        # images, fonts (imported)
  components/
  pages/         # if SPA/MPA routing
  routes/        # file-based router configs if used
  styles/
  lib/           # shared utils
  api/           # client-side API wrappers
  main.tsx       # React/Vue/Solid entry
  index.html     # app HTML (root) or under project root
public/          # copied as-is at build time



2) TypeScript & Aliases
	•	Strict TS (tsconfig.json)

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "lib": ["ESNext", "DOM"],
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "strictNullChecks": true,
    "moduleResolution": "bundler",
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": { "@/": ["src/"] }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}


	•	Vite alias (vite.config.ts)

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import path from 'node:path';

export default defineConfig({
  resolve: { alias: { '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src') } }
});



3) Environment Variables
	•	Files: .env, .env.development, .env.production.
	•	Only variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to the client.
	•	Access via import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL.
	•	Derive mode: vite --mode staging (loads .env.staging).

4) Dev Server Standards
	•	HMR on by default; prefer component-level state preservation.
	•	Proxy to backend (avoids CORS during dev):

server: {
  host: true, port: 5173, open: true,
  proxy: {
    '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:3000', changeOrigin: true }
  }
}


	•	HTTPS local (when testing secure APIs)

import fs from 'node:fs';
server: {
  https: {
    key: fs.readFileSync('certs/localhost-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('certs/localhost.pem')
  }
}



5) CSS, PostCSS & Tailwind
	•	Import global styles in main.tsx:

import '@/styles/global.css';


	•	PostCSS: postcss.config.cjs with autoprefixer.
	•	Tailwind (if used): content globs include ./index.html, ./src//*.{ts,tsx,vue,html}. Put tokens in theme.extend.

6) Assets (Images, Fonts, SVG)
	•	Import assets for hashing & tree-shaking:

import logoUrl from '@/assets/logo.svg';


	•	Inline small assets automatically (configurable by assetsInlineLimit).
	•	Prefer SVG as components with a plugin (e.g., vite-plugin-svgr) in React projects.

7) Routing
	•	Vite is unopinionated; bring your router (React Router, TanStack Router, Vue Router).
	•	For multi-page apps (MPA), configure rollup input:

build: {
  rollupOptions: {
    input: { main: 'index.html', admin: 'admin/index.html' }
  }
}



8) Security & CSP (important for media/blob)
	•	Add a Content-Security-Policy header in dev & prod:
	•	For using media/recording/Blob URLs:

default-src 'self';
script-src 'self';
style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
img-src 'self' blob: data:;
media-src 'self' blob: data:;
connect-src 'self' https: ws: wss:;




	•	Dev header (Vite):

server: {
  headers: {
    'Content-Security-Policy':
      "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' blob: data:; media-src 'self' blob: data:; connect-src 'self' https: ws: wss:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
  }
}


	•	In production, configure headers at your host (Vercel/Netlify/Nginx).

9) Build Configuration
	•	Common build options:

build: {
  target: 'es2020',
  outDir: 'dist',
  sourcemap: true,
  cssMinify: true,
  chunkSizeWarningLimit: 800,
  rollupOptions: {
    output: {
      manualChunks: {
        vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'],       // example
        ui: ['@radix-ui/react-slot']          // example
      }
    }
  }
}


	•	Code splitting via dynamic import:

const Page = lazy(() => import('./pages/HeavyPage'));


	•	Preload important chunks with <link rel="preload" ...> in index.html if truly critical.

10) Optimize Dev Start (optimizeDeps)
	•	Speed up first run by prebundling deps:

optimizeDeps: {
  include: ['react', 'react-dom', 'zustand'],
  exclude: ['@supabase/supabase-js'] // if it causes ESM warnings in dev
}



11) Plugins (curate, don’t hoard)
	•	React: @vitejs/plugin-react (with SWC for speed).
	•	Vue: @vitejs/plugin-vue.
	•	Solid: vite-plugin-solid.
	•	SVG as components: vite-plugin-svgr.
	•	PWA: vite-plugin-pwa (offline caching/manifest).
	•	Legacy browser support: @vitejs/plugin-legacy (only if required).
	•	Inspect bundles: rollup-plugin-visualizer (analyze chunk sizes).

12) Testing & Linting
	•	Vitest (fast, Vite-native):

// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
export default defineConfig({
  test: { globals: true, environment: 'jsdom', setupFiles: ['./src/test/setup.ts'] }
});


	•	ESLint & Prettier with TS and framework plugins; run in CI.
	•	Typecheck in CI: tsc --noEmit.

13) Performance Guidelines
	•	Prefer ESM dependencies; avoid CJS where possible.
	•	Use route/code splitting for large pages.
	•	Tree-shake UI libraries (import per-component).
	•	Memoize expensive renders (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) only when profiles show benefit.
	•	Load images responsively; set width/height and loading="lazy".

14) Library Mode (for building packages)
	•	Configure build.lib:

build: {
  lib: {
    entry: 'src/index.ts',
    name: 'MyLib',
    formats: ['es', 'cjs'],
    fileName: (f) => mylib.${f}.js
  },
  rollupOptions: { external: ['react', 'react-dom'] }
}


	•	Generate type declarations with tsup or rollup-plugin-dts.

15) SSR & Frameworks
	•	Vite supports SSR; use your framework’s adapter (e.g., vite-ssr, SvelteKit, SolidStart, Nuxt/Vite for Vue).
	•	For Next.js, you typically don’t use Vite (Next uses its own toolchain).

16) Deployment
	•	Preview build locally: vite preview.
	•	Static hosting (Netlify, Vercel static, S3/CloudFront):
	•	Upload dist/.
	•	Configure SPA fallback: rewrite /* → /index.html.
	•	Server-side hosting (if you have APIs under same origin): reverse-proxy Vite output or containerize with Nginx serving dist.

17) Troubleshooting Cheatsheet

Symptom	Likely Cause	Fix
HMR disconnects on mobile	LAN not exposed or firewall	server.host: true, open port, use --host
Red screen “CSP blocked blob:”	CSP missing blob: in media-src/img-src	Add CSP for blob: data:
import.meta.env undefined	Missing VITE_ prefix	Rename env var to VITE_*
CORS errors to API	Cross-origin requests in dev	Configure server.proxy
Huge vendor chunk	UI kit fully imported	Use per-module imports, manualChunks
Slow dev start	Many deps / CJS	optimizeDeps.include, remove heavy unused deps

18) Example vite.config.ts (React + TS, secure dev headers)

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
import path from 'node:path';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: { alias: { '@': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src') } },
  server: {
    host: true,
    port: 5173,
    open: true,
    headers: {
      'Content-Security-Policy':
        "default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' blob: data:; media-src 'self' blob: data:; connect-src 'self' https: ws: wss:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
    },
    proxy: {
      '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:3000', changeOrigin: true }
    }
  },
  build: {
    target: 'es2020',
    sourcemap: true,
    rollupOptions: {
      output: { manualChunks: { vendor: ['react', 'react-dom'] } }
    }
  },
  optimizeDeps: {
    include: ['react', 'react-dom']
  }
});


⸻

Quick Checklist
	•	Strict TS + path aliases
	•	Env vars with VITE_ prefix
	•	Dev proxy to backend
	•	CSP allows blob: if using media/recording
	•	Code split heavy routes
	•	Analyze bundle (visualizer) before release
	•	Typecheck, lint, test in CI
	•	SPA fallback configured in hosting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VS Code Development Standards

1) Core Principles
	•	Editor is part of the codebase: keep reproducible settings in .vscode/ and commit them (except secrets).
	•	Automate the routine: format on save, fix on save, task/launch configs, and snippets.
	•	Profiles: use separate VS Code Profiles for different stacks (e.g., Web, Python, Data) to isolate extensions/settings.

⸻

2) Workspace Layout (.vscode/)

4) Keybindings (portable, high-value)

Mac ⇧ means Shift, ⌘ Cmd, ⌥ Opt; Windows/Linux use Ctrl/Alt.

	•	Command Palette: ⌘⇧P / Ctrl+Shift+P
	•	Quick Open: ⌘P / Ctrl+P
	•	Side Bar: ⌘B / Ctrl+B
	•	Terminal toggle: ⌃`  / Ctrl+` 
	•	Multi-cursor: ⌥Click / Alt+Click, or ⌘⌥↓ / Ctrl+Alt+Down
	•	Rename symbol: F2
	•	Format document: ⌥⇧F / Alt+Shift+F
	•	Peek definition: ⌥F12 / Alt+F12
	•	Navigate errors: F8 / Shift+F8
	•	Global search: ⌘⇧F / Ctrl+Shift+F (regex supported)
	•	Toggle comment: ⌘/ / Ctrl+/

Keep custom keys in File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts → open keybindings.json.

5) Built-in Terminals & Tasks

Terminals
	•	Use named terminals per service: web, api, db.
	•	Persist commands with Tasks so anyone can run them identically.

tasks.json examples

{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    { "label": "dev:web", "type": "shell", "command": "pnpm dev", "options": { "cwd": "web" }, "group": "build", "problemMatcher": [] },
    { "label": "dev:api", "type": "shell", "command": "pnpm dev", "options": { "cwd": "api" }, "group": "build" },
    { "label": "test:watch", "type": "shell", "command": "pnpm test:watch", "group": "test" }
  ]
}

Run with Terminal > Run Task… or map to a keybinding.

⸻

6) Debugging (launch.json)
	•	Prefer attaching debuggers to your dev servers for step-through and breakpoints.

{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Node: Launch API",
      "type": "node",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${workspaceFolder}/api/src/index.ts",
      "runtimeExecutable": "pnpm",
      "runtimeArgs": ["ts-node/register", "-r", "dotenv/config"],
      "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env",
      "console": "integratedTerminal",
      "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/"]
    },
    {
      "name": "Chrome: Web App",
      "type": "pwa-chrome",
      "request": "launch",
      "url": "http://localhost:5173",
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/web/src"
    }
  ]
}

7) Snippets & Emmet

Project snippets (.vscode/snippets/web.json)

{
  "React Component": {
    "prefix": "rfc",
    "body": [
      "import React from 'react';",
      "",
      "interface ${1:Name}Props {",
      "  ",
      "}",
      "",
      "export function ${1:Name}(props: ${1:Name}Props) {",
      "  return <div>${1:Name}</div>;",
      "}"
    ]
  }
}

Emmet tips
	•	Enable for JSX: "emmet.includeLanguages": { "javascript": "javascriptreact", "typescript": "typescriptreact" }
	•	Abbrev: ul>li*3 → list with 3 items.

⸻

8) Git & Reviews
	•	Source Control panel for staging/commits and diffing.
	•	GitLens for blame/line history and PR integration.
	•	Enforce pre-commit hooks via Husky (lint, type-check, test) and expose them as Tasks.

⸻

9) Code Quality & Security
	•	ESLint + Prettier: fix/format on save; keep configs in repo.
	•	Spell Checker: streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker for docs/strings.
	•	Secret scanning: add .vscode/settings.json with "search.exclude" for */.env; use Git hooks to prevent committing secrets.
	•	Use Problems panel (⇧⌘M / Ctrl+Shift+M) and Error Lens extension to surface diagnostics inline.

⸻

10) Remote Dev (WSL, SSH, Dev Containers)
	•	Dev Containers (.devcontainer/) for fully reproducible environments; pair with .vscode/.
	•	Remote-WSL on Windows for Linux tooling.
	•	Remote-SSH to develop directly on servers/VMs.

Minimal .devcontainer/devcontainer.json:

{
  "name": "Node Web",
  "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/typescript-node:20",
  "postCreateCommand": "pnpm i",
  "customizations": {
    "vscode": {
      "extensions": ["dbaeumer.vscode-eslint", "esbenp.prettier-vscode", "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss"]
    }
  }
}


⸻

11) Performance & Ergonomics
	•	Disable heavy/unused extensions in this workspace (right-click → Disable (Workspace)).
	•	Turn off telemetry if desired.
	•	Keep explorer clean with:

"files.exclude": {
  "/.git": true, "/node_modules": true, "/.next": true, "/dist": true
}


	•	Use Breadcrumbs and Go to Symbol (⌘⇧O / Ctrl+Shift+O) for large files.

⸻

12) Accessibility
	•	High contrast theme if needed.
	•	Tab moves focus: cmd palette → Toggle Tab Key Moves Focus.
	•	Screen reader support: editor.accessibilitySupport: "on".

⸻

13) Search / Replace Power
	•	Use regex searches:
	•	Find words in quotes: "(.*?)"
	•	Trim trailing spaces:  +$ (Replace with nothing)
	•	Files to include/exclude directly from search panel.

⸻

14) Common Project Profiles (suggested)
	•	Web (React/Next): ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, TypeScript Next, Jest/Vitest, Playwright.
	•	Node/API: ESLint, Prettier, REST Client or Thunder Client, Docker, Jest.
	•	Python/Data: Pylance, Black, isort, Jupyter, Python, Ruff.

⸻

15) Quick “Getting Started” for new contributors
	1.	Install VS Code.
	2.	Open project; VS Code suggests recommended extensions — install.
	3.	pnpm i (or npm/yarn).
	4.	Use Tasks: dev:web, dev:api.
	5.	Press F5 to debug, or run configured launch.json.
	6.	Commit with conventional messages; push via Source Control pane.

⸻

16) Troubleshooting Cheats
	•	Format not working → Check default formatter ("editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode").
	•	ESLint slow/noisy → Disable TypeScript validation duplication or large folder scanning via "eslint.workingDirectories".
	•	Debugger not attaching → Ensure source maps enabled and paths match webRoot.
	•	Terminal shell issues → Set "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.*" to your shell.
