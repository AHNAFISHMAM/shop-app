Help the user paste content into Claude Code:

## For Text:
1. Explain that regular Ctrl+V should work for text
2. Show how to paste code blocks
3. Explain multi-line input support

## For Images/Screenshots:
1. Check if they have a screenshot saved anywhere
2. Offer to read the image file if they provide the path
3. Common screenshot locations:
   - `C:\Users\Lenovo\Pictures\Screenshots\`
   - `C:\Users\Lenovo\Downloads\`
   - Desktop: `C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\`
4. Ask for the file path if they've saved it

## Alternative Methods:
- Save screenshot first, then provide file path
- Use Windows Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S) and save
- Tell me the file location and I'll read it with the Read tool

## Quick Actions:
- If they mention a path, immediately offer to read it
- List recent files in common screenshot locations
- Show examples of how to reference files

Ask what they're trying to paste and help them with the best method!
