Help the user paste an image or screenshot:

## Step 1: Check if they have the image ready
Ask: "Do you have a screenshot in your clipboard or saved as a file?"

## Step 2: Guide them to save it
If in clipboard:
- "Please save your screenshot first using one of these methods:"
  - Press Win+Shift+S, capture the area, then click 'Save' in the notification
  - Or press Win+PrtScn (saves to Pictures/Screenshots automatically)
  - Or paste into Paint and save to Downloads

## Step 3: Auto-find the most recent screenshot
Search these locations for the newest image (from last 5 minutes):
1. `C:\Users\Lenovo\Pictures\Screenshots\`
2. `C:\Users\Lenovo\Downloads\`
3. `C:\Users\Lenovo\Desktop\`
4. Current project directory

List recent .png, .jpg, .jpeg files sorted by newest first.

## Step 4: Auto-read the newest one
If found within last 2 minutes, ask: "I found this recent screenshot: [filename]. Should I read it?"

If they say yes or just press Enter, immediately use the Read tool to view and analyze the image.

## Step 5: If no recent file found
Ask them to:
1. Save the screenshot now
2. Tell me the file path, or
3. Just press this shortcut again after saving

Make this as seamless as possible - like pasting, but with one extra save step!
